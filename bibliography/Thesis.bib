abstract = {OBJECT: In this prospective multicenter study the authors hypothesized that investigational epidural cortical stimulation (CS) delivered concurrently with rehabilitation therapy may enhance motor recovery following stroke. METHODS: Patients who had suffered their index stroke {\textgreater}or= 4 months previously were randomized into 6 weeks of rehabilitation therapy with or without CS. Cortical stimulation, targeted by functional imaging, was delivered at approximately 50{\%} of motor movement threshold. Primary outcome measures were Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM [a measure of neurological and motor function]) and Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT [a measure of activities of daily living]) scores. The primary study end point was 4 weeks following rehabilitation therapy. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients, 12 per group, completed the treatment protocol. The mean interval since the patients' index stroke was 33 months (range 4-100 months). There were no deaths or cases of neurological deterioration; 1 acute postoperative seizure occurred unrelated to the device or treatment. Patients who underwent CS experienced improved hand/arm function more than control patients. The UEFM score improved 5.5 +/- 4.4 points in patients in the CS group compared with 1.9 +/- 4.4 points for controls (p = 0.03). A 3.5-point UEFM improvement is considered clinically meaningful. The AMAT scores for the CS group improved by 0.4 +/- 0.6 points, whereas the scores in the control group improved by 0.2 +/- 0.4 points (p = 0.2). A 0.21-point improvement in AMAT score is considered clinically meaningful. In the CS group, 67{\%} of patients had clinically meaningful improvement in UEFM scores, compared with 25{\%} of the control group (p = 0.05). Of patients in the CS group 50{\%} had clinically meaningful improvement in UEFM as well as AMAT scores, compared with only 8{\%} of those in the control group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that subthreshold epidural CS is safe and effective during rehabilitation for recovery of arm and hand function following hemiparetic stroke. Further research in a larger cohort is needed to validate the therapeutic effect.},

abstract = {Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, but nearly all of us learn to do it effortlessly. Production of fluent speech requires the precise, coordinated movement of multiple articulators (for example, the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx) over rapid time scales. Here we used high-resolution, multi-electrode cortical recordings during the production of consonant-vowel syllables to determine the organization of speech sensorimotor cortex in humans. We found speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically on ventral pre- and post-central gyri, and that partially overlap at individual electrodes. These representations were coordinated temporally as sequences during syllable production. Spatial patterns of cortical activity showed an emergent, population-level representation, which was organized by phonetic features. Over tens of milliseconds, the spatial patterns transitioned between distinct representations for different consonants and vowels. These results reveal the dynamic organization of speech sensorimotor cortex during the generation of multi-articulator movements that underlies our ability to speak.},

abstract = {The possiblility of neural injury during prolonged electri- cal stimulation of the brain imposes some constraints on the use of this technique for therapeutic and experimental applications. Stimulating electrodes of various sizes were used to investigate the interactions of two stimulus parameters, charge density and charge per phase, in de- terming the threshold of neural injury induced by electrical stimula- tion. Platinum electrodes ranging in size from 0.002 to 0.5 Em2 were implanted over the parietal cortex of adult cats. Penetrating micro- electrodes fabricated from iridium, with surface areas of 65 f 3 x cm2 were inserted into the parietal cortex. Ten days after implan- tation, the electrodes were pulsed continuously for 7h using charge bal- anced, current regulated, symmetric pulse pairs, 400 ps per phase in duration, at a repetition rate of 50 Hz. The animals were perfused immediately after the stimulation for histologic evaluation of the brain tissue subjacent to the electrode sites. The results show that charge density (as measured at the surface of the stimulating electrode), and charge per phase, interact in a synergistic manner to determine the threshold of stimulation-induced neural injury. This interaction occurs over a wide range of both parameters; for charge density from at least 10 to 800 pC/cm2 and, for charge per phase, from at least 0.05 to 5.0 pC per phase. The significance of these findings in elucidating the mechanisms underlying stimulation-induced injury is discussed. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Artificial activation of neural circuitry through electrical microstimulation and optogenetic techniques is important for both scientific discovery of circuit function and for engineered approaches to alleviate various disorders of the nervous system. However, evidence suggests that neural activity generated by artificial stimuli differs dramatically from normal circuit function, in terms of both the local neuronal population activity at the site of activation and the propagation to downstream brain structures. The precise nature of these differences and the implications for information processing remain unknown. Here, we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging of primary somatosensory cortex in the anesthetized rat in response to deflections of the facial vibrissae and electrical or optogenetic stimulation of thalamic neurons that project directly to the somatosensory cortex. Although the different inputs produced responses that were similar in terms of the average cortical activation, the variability of the cortical response was strikingly different for artificial versus sensory inputs. Furthermore, electrical microstimulation resulted in highly unnatural spatial activation of cortex, whereas optical input resulted in spatial cortical activation thatwassimilar to that inducedbysensory inputs.Athalamocorticalnetworkmodelsuggested that observed differences could be explained by differences in the way in which artificial and natural inputs modulate the magnitude and synchrony of population activity. Finally, the variability structure in the response for each case strongly influenced the optimal inputs for driving the pathway from the perspective of an ideal observer of cortical activation when considered in the context of information transmission.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to quantify the electrode-tissue interface impedance of electrodes used for deep brain stimulation (DBS). We measured the impedance of DBS electrodes using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in vitro in carbonate and phosphate buffered saline solution and in vivo following acute implantation in the brain. The components of the impedance, including the series resistance (Rs), the Faradaic resistance (Rf) and the double layer capacitance (Cdl), were estimated using an equivalent electrical circuit. Both Rf and Cdl decreased as the sinusoidal frequency was increased, but the ratio of capacitive charge transfer to Faradaic charge transfer was relatively insensitive to the change of frequency. Rf decreased and Cdl increased as the current density was increased, and above a critical current density the interface impedance became nonlinear. Thus the magnitude of the interface impedance was strongly dependent on the intensity (pulse amplitude and duration) of stimulation. The temporal dependence and spatial non- uniformity of Rf and Cdl suggested that a distributed network, with each element of the network having dynamics tailored to a specific stimulus waveform, is required to describe adequately the impedance of the DBS electrode-tissue interface. Voltage transients to biphasic square current pulses were measured and suggested that the electrode-tissue interface did not operate in a linear range at clinically-relevant current amplitudes, and that the assumption of the DBS electrode being ideally polarizable was not valid under clinical stimulating conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Paired-pulse (PP) paradigms are commonly employed to assess in vivo cortical excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to stimulate the primary motor cortex and modulate the induced motor evoked potential (MEP). Single-pulse cortical direct electrical stimulation (DES) during intracerebral EEG monitoring allows the investigation of brain connectivity by eliciting cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). However, PP paradigm using intracerebral DES has rarely been reported and has never been previously compared with TMS. OBJECTIVE The work was intended (i) to verify that the well-established modulations of MEPs following PP TMS remain similar using DES in the motor cortex, and (ii) to evaluate if a similar pattern could be observed in distant cortico-cortical connections through modulations of CCEP. METHODS Three patients undergoing intracerebral EEG monitoring with electrodes implanted in the central region were studied. Single-pulse DES (1-3 mA, 1 ms, 0.2 Hz) and PP DES using six interstimulus intervals (5, 15, 30, 50, 100, and 200 ms) in the motor cortex with concomitant recording of CCEPs and MEPs in contralateral muscles were performed. Finally, a navigated PP TMS session targeted the intracranial stimulation site to record TMS-induced MEPs in two patients. RESULTS MEP modulations elicited by PP intracerebral DES proved similar among the three patients and to those obtained by PP TMS. CCEP modulations elicited by PP intracerebral DES usually showed a pattern comparable to that of MEP, although a different pattern could be observed occasionally. CONCLUSION PP intracerebral DES seems to involve excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms similar to PP TMS and allows the recording of intracortical inhibition and facilitation modulation on cortico-cortical connections.

abstract = {The goal of this study was to identify stimulus parameters and electrode geometries that were effective in selectively stimulating targeted neuronal populations within the central nervous system (CNS). Cable models of neurons that included an axon, initial segment, soma, and branching dendritic tree, with geometries and membrane dynamics derived from mammalian motoneurons, were used to study excitation with extracellular electrodes. The models reproduced a wide range of experimentally documented excitation patterns including current-distance and strength-duration relationships. Evaluation of different stimulus paradigms was performed using populations of fifty cells and fifty fibers of passage randomly positioned about an extracellular electrode(s). Monophasic cathodic or anodic stimuli enabled selective stimulation of fibers over cells or cells over fibers, respectively. However, when a symmetrical charge-balancing stimulus phase was incorporated, selectivity was greatly diminished. An anodic first, cathodic second asymmetrical biphasic stimulus enabled selective stimulation of fibers, while a cathodic first, anodic second asymmetrical biphasic stimulus enabled selective stimulation of cells. These novel waveforms provided enhanced selectivity while preserving charge balancing as is required to minimize the risk of electrode corrosion and tissue injury. Furthermore, the models developed in this study can predict the effectiveness of electrode geometries and stimulus parameters for selective activation of specific neuronal populations, and in turn represent useful tools for the design of electrodes and stimulus waveforms for use in CNS neural prosthetic devices.},

abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to improve functionality in chronic stoke patients when applied over a large number of sessions. Here, we evaluate the effect and the underlying mechanisms of three BCI training sessions in a double-blind-sham-controlled design. The applied BCI is based on Hebbian principles of associativity that hypothesizes that neural assemblies activated in a correlated manner will strengthen synaptic connections. Twenty-two chronic stroke patients were allocated into two training groups. Movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) were detected using elecroencephalography during repetitions of foot dorsiflexion. Detection triggered a single electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve timed so that the resulting afferent volley arrived at the peak negative phase of the MRCP (BCIassociative group) or randomly (BCInon-associative group). Fugl-Meyer motor assessment (FM), 10-m walking speed, foot and hand tapping frequency and the excitability of the corticospinal tract to the target muscle (tibialis anterior (TA)) were quantified. The TA motor evoked potential increased significantly following the BCIassociative intervention, but not for the BCInon-associative group. Fugl-Meyer motor scores (0.8±0.46 point difference p=0.01), foot (but not finger) tapping frequency, and 10-m walking speed improved significantly for the BCIassociative group, indicating clinically relevant improvements. For the BCI as applied here, the precise coupling between the brain command and the afferent signal was imperative for the behavioral, clinical and neurophysiological changes reported. This association may become the driving principle for the design of BCI rehabilitation in the future. Indeed no available BCIs can match this degree of functional improvement with such a short intervention.},

abstract = {Electrical stimulation is a widely used and effective tool in systems neuroscience, neural prosthetics, and clinical neurostimulation. However, electrical artifacts evoked by stimulation significantly complicate the detection of spiking activity on nearby recording electrodes. Here, we present ERAASR: an algorithm for Estimation and Removal of Artifacts on Arrays via Sequential principal components Regression. This approach leverages the similar structure of artifact transients, but not spiking activity, across simultaneously recorded channels on the array, across pulses within a train, and across trials. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated in macaque dorsal premotor cortex using acute linear multielectrode array recordings and single electrode stimulation. Large electrical artifacts appeared on all channels during stimulation. After application of ERAASR, the cleaned signals were quiescent on channels with no spontaneous spiking activity, whereas spontaneously active channels exhibited evoked spikes which closely resembled spontaneously occurring spiking waveforms. The ERAASR algorithm requires no special hardware and comprises sequential application of straightforward linear methods with intuitive parameters. Enabling simultaneous electrical stimulation and multielectrode array recording can help elucidate the causal links between neural activity and cognitive functions and enable the design and implementation of novel sensory protheses.},

abstract = {Many important questions in neuroscience are about interactions between neurons or neuronal groups. These interactions are often quantified by coherence, which is a frequency-indexed measure that quantifies the extent to which two signals exhibit a consistent phase relation. In this paper, we consider the statistical testing of the difference between coherence values observed in two experimental conditions. We pay special attention to problems induced by (1) unequal sample sizes and (2) the fact that coherence is typically evaluated at a large number of frequency bins and between large numbers of pairs of neurons or neuronal groups (the multiple comparisons problem). We show that nonparametric statistical tests provide convincing and elegant solutions for both problems. We also show that these tests allow to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the test. Finally, we explain why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis. The proposed methodology is illustrated by analyses of data collected in a study on cortico-spinal coherence [Schoffelen JM, Oostenveld R, Fries P. Neuronal coherence as a mechanism of effective corticospinal interaction. Science 2005;308(5718):111-3]. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cortical stimulation (CS) combined with rehabilitation may improve upper limb motor function after stroke. OBJECTIVE: Describe the study design for the Everest Clinical Trial, a randomized single-blinded pivotal device trial, testing safety and efficacy of epidural CS delivered during rehabilitation for upper limb motor function in patients with ischemic stroke. METHOD: A total of 174 participants from 21 centers with hemiplegia at least 4 months after acute ischemic stroke are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to investigational or control groups. Investigational patients undergo implantation of cortical electrode and pulse generator and receive 6 weeks of upper limb rehabilitation with subthreshold CS delivered only during therapy. Control group patients receive the same therapy without device implantation or stimulation. Primary outcome measures include the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) score and the arm motor ability test (AMAT) measured at baseline and 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks following rehabilitation treatment with primary endpoint at 4 weeks following treatment. A successful outcome is defined as an improvement in UEFM of at least 4.5 points and in AMAT of at least 0.21 points from baseline to primary endpoint. A 20{\%} better success rate between investigational and control groups will be considered clinically meaningful. Adverse events occurring during the study will be identified. RESULTS: Not applicable. CONCLUSIONS: The Everest Clinical Trial is the first randomized pivotal trial on the safety and efficacy of direct CS delivered during rehabilitation for recovery of upper limb motor function in patients with ischemic stroke.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Current brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) rely on visual feedback, requiring sustained visual attention to use the device. Improvements to BCIs may stem from the development of an effective way to provide quick feedback independent of vision. Tactile stimuli, either delivered on the skin surface, or directly to the brain via microstimulation in somatosensory cortex, could serve that purpose. We examined the effectiveness of vibrotactile stimuli and microstimulation as a means of non-visual feedback by using a fundamental element of feedback: the ability to react to a stimulus while already in motion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH: Human and monkey subjects performed a center-out reach task which was, on occasion, interrupted with a stimulus cue that instructed a change in reach target.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: Subjects generally responded faster to tactile cues than to visual cues. However, when we delivered cues via microstimuation in a monkey, its response was slower on average than for both tactile and visual cues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: Tactile and microstimulation feedback can be used to rapidly adjust movements mid-flight. The relatively slow speed of microstimulation is surprising and warrants further investigation. Overall, these results highlight the importance of considering temporal aspects of feedback when designing alternative forms of feedback for BCIs.},

Five different tissue types were incorporated into the model based on conductivities taken from the literature. The boundary value problem derived from Laplace's equation was solved with a quasistatic approximation. Transcranial electrical stimulation with scalp electrodes was poorly focussed and required high levels of current for stimulation of the cortex. Direct cortical stimulation with bipolar (adjacent) electrodes was found to be very effective in producing localized current flows. Unipolar cortical stimulation (with a more distant reference electrode) produced higher current densities at the same stimulating current as did bipolar stimulation, but stimulated a larger region of the cortex. With the simulated electrodes resting on the pia-arachnoid, as usually occurs clinically, there was significant shunting of the current (7/8 of the total current) through the CSF. Possible changes in electrodes and stimulation parameters that might improve stimulation procedures are discovered. ?? 1993.},

Patients underwent a 5-7 d monitoring period with array placement, before seizure focus resection, and during this time they participated in the study. An interval-based motor-repetition task produced consistent and quantifiable spectral shifts that were mapped on a Talairach-standardized template cortex. Maps were created independently for a high-frequency band (HFB) (76-100 Hz) and a low-frequency band (LFB) (8-32 Hz) for several different movement modalities in each subject. The power in relevant electrodes consistently decreased in the LFB with movement, whereas the power in the HFB consistently increased. In addition, the HFB changes were more focal than the LFB changes. Sites of power changes corresponded to stereotactic locations in sensorimotor cortex and to the results of individual clinical electrical cortical mapping. Sensorimotor representation was found to be somatotopic, localized in stereotactic space to rolandic cortex, and typically followed the classic homunculus with limited extrarolandic representation.},

This paper reports on a novel multimodal interface using auditory, haptic and visual feedback in a direct manipulation task to establish new recommendations for multimodal feedback, in particular uni-, bi- and trimodal feedback. A close examination of combinations of uni-, bi- and trimodal feedback is necessary to determine which enhances performance without increasing workload. Thirty-two participants were asked to complete a task consisting of a series of ‘drag-and-drops' while the type of feedback was manipulated. Each participant was exposed to three unimodal feedback conditions, three bimodal feedback conditions and one trimodal feedback condition that used auditory, visual and haptic feedback alone, and in combination. Performance under the different conditions was assessed with measures of trial completion time, target highlight time and a self-reported workload assessment captured by the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). The findings suggest that certain types of bimodal feedback can enhance performance while lowering self-perceived mental demand.},

abstract = {Plasticity is a crucial component of normal brain function and a critical mechanism for recovery from injury. Numerous experimental studies have attempted to elucidate its underlying mechanisms under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Short latency, associative pairing of presynaptic "trigger" spiking with stimulus-induced postsynaptic depolarization of a target neuron has been shown to lead to changes in the effectiveness of a stimulus applied to the presynaptic neuron. We have used similar methods to demonstrate changes in the statistically inferred functional connections among small groups of recorded neurons in rat sensorimotor cortex. These induced changes transcended simple changes in stimulus-evoked activity. Rather, they reflected a robust reorganization of network connectivity revealed by changes in the patterns of spikes in the cells' spontaneous discharge. We hypothesized that by strengthening the functional connections from trigger to target neurons, we might demonstrate a related behavioral change. To test this hypothesis, we trained rats to respond to a near-threshold, intracortical stimulus cue. Following 1-2 days of paired, short latency stimulation, the sensitivity of these rats to the cue was increased. The latency dependence and the timecourse of this effect were very similar to the corresponding parameters of the inferred connectivity changes in the first experiment. Such targeted connectivity changes may provide a tool for rerouting the flow of information through a cortical network, with profound implications for both rehabilitation and brain-machine interface applications.},

abstract = {A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in human higher cortical functions requires a detailed knowledge of neuronal connectivity between functional cortical regions. Currently no good method for tracking in vivo neuronal connectivity exists. We investigated the inter-areal connections in vivo in the human language system using a new method, which we termed 'cortico-cortical evoked potentials' (CCEPs). Eight patients with epilepsy (age 13-42 years) underwent invasive monitoring with subdural electrodes for epilepsy surgery. Six patients had language dominance on the side of grid implantation and two had bilateral language representation by the intracarotid amobarbital test. Conventional cortical electrical stimulation was performed to identify the anterior and posterior language areas. Single pulse electrical stimuli were delivered to the anterior language (eight patients), posterior language (four patients) or face motor (two patients) area, and CCEPs were obtained by averaging electrocorticograms (ECoGs) recorded from the perisylvian and extrasylvian basal temporal language areas time-locked to the stimulus. The subjects were not asked to perform any tasks during the study. Stimulation at the anterior language area elicited CCEPs in the lateral temporo-parietal area (seven of eight patients) in the middle and posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus, the adjacent part of the middle temporal gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus. CCEPs were recorded in 3-21 electrodes per patient. CCEPs occurred at or around the particular electrodes in the posterior language area which, when stimulated, produced speech arrest. Similar early and late CCEPs were obtained from the basal temporal area by stimulating the anterior language area (three of three patients). In contrast, stimulation of the adjacent face motor area did not elicit CCEPs in language areas but rather in the postcentral gyrus. Stimulation of the posterior language area produced CCEPs in the anterior language (three of four patients) as well as in the basal temporal area (one of two patients). These CCEPs were less well defined. These findings suggest that perisylvian and extrasylvian language areas participate in the language system as components of a network by means of feed-forward and feed-back projections. Different from the classical Wernicke-Geschwind model, the present study revealed a bidirectional connection between Broca's and Wernicke's areas probably through the arcuate fasciculus and/or the cortico-subcortico-cortical pathway. CCEPs were recorded from a larger area than the posterior language area identified by electrical stimulation. This suggests the existence of a rather broad neuronal network surrounding the previously recognized core region of this area.},

The complex development of this cell type and the intricacies involved in defining the relative subtypes are being increasingly well defined. This has led to exciting experimental cell therapy in model organisms, whereby fetal-derived interneuron precursors can reverse seizure severity and reduce mortality in adult epileptic rodents. These proof-of-principle studies raise hope for potential interneuron-based transplantation therapies for treating epilepsy. On the other hand, cortical neurons generated from patient iPSCs serve as a valuable tool to explore genetic influences of interneuron development and function. This is a fundamental step in enhancing our understanding of the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric illnesses and the development of targeted treatments. Protocols are currently being developed for inducing cortical interneuron subtypes from mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. This review sets out to summarize the progress made in cortical interneuron development, fetal tissue transplantation and the recent advance in stem cell differentiation toward interneurons.},

abstract = {Extracellular electrical stimulation of the gray matter is often used to determine the function of a given cortical area or pathway. However, when it is used to elicit postsynaptic effects, the presynaptic neuronal elements activated by electrical stimulation have never been clearly identified: it could be the excitable dendrites, the cell body, the axon initial segment, or the axonal branches. To identify these elements, we performed two series of experiments on slices of rat visual cortex maintained in vitro. The first series of experiments, reported in this paper, was aimed at determining the chronaxie, a temporal parameter related to the membrane properties of the neuronal elements. In order to identify the presynaptic elements that were activated by extracellular electrical stimulation, chronaxies corresponding to postsynaptic responses were measured and compared with those corresponding to the activation of axons (antidromic activation) and those corresponding to the activation of cell bodies (intracellular current injection in intracellularly recorded neurons). The chronaxie for orthodromic activation was similar to that for axonal activation, but was 40 times smaller than the chronaxie for direct cell body activation. This suggests that, whenever a postsynaptic response is elicited after electrical stimulation of the cortical gray matter, axons (either axonal branches or axon initial segments), but not cell bodies, are the neuronal elements activated.},

abstract = {Life table analysis is a powerful statistical tool that has become the preferred technique for studying both the natural history of and the effect of treatment on disease outcome. We have found only one report using life table analysis to study rehabilitation outcome after stroke. We assessed the recovery of both independent ambulation and overall self-care function in 95 consecutive patients with unilateral hemispheric stroke using life table analysis. Our results support the segregation of patients into the following prognostic subgroups at the time of entry into the rehabilitation program (mean +/- SD 5 +/- 3 weeks after stroke): 1) motor deficit only, 2) motor deficit plus somatic sensory deficit, and 3) motor deficit plus somatic sensory deficit plus homonymous visual deficit. The probabilities of reaching independence in ambulation, being able to walk 150 feet with assistance, reaching independence in self-care function, and reaching a point of assisted self care (Barthel Index score of greater than or equal to 60) are highly significantly different among subgroups. The interval after stroke required to reach the plateau phase of recovery is also significantly different among subgroups. We propose that life table analysis can be used 1) to define patient outcome goals, 2) to define the time required to reach such goals, 3) to identify patients with medical or behavioral comorbidity who are functioning below their expected level, and 4) to assess the effect of alternative treatment regimens on both final outcome and time to reach that outcome.},

abstract = {The brain typically uses a rich supply of feedback from multiple sensory modalities to control movement in healthy individuals. In many individuals, these afferent pathways, as well as their efferent counterparts, are compromised by disease or injury resulting in significant impairments and reduced quality of life. Brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) offer the promise of recovered functionality to these individuals by allowing them to control a device using their thoughts. Most current BMI implementations use visual feedback for closed-loop control; however, it has been suggested that the inclusion of additional feedback modalities may lead to improvements in control. We demonstrate for the first time that kinesthetic feedback can be used together with vision to significantly improve control of a cursor driven by neural activity of the primary motor cortex (MI). Using an exoskeletal robot, the monkey's arm was moved to passively follow a cortically controlled visual cursor, thereby providing the monkey with kinesthetic information about the motion of the cursor. When visual and proprioceptive feedback were congruent, both the time to successfully reach a target decreased and the cursor paths became straighter, compared with incongruent feedback conditions. This enhanced performance was accompanied by a significant increase in the amount of movement-related information contained in the spiking activity of neurons in MI. These findings suggest that BMI control can be significantly improved in paralyzed patients with residual kinesthetic sense and provide the groundwork for augmenting cortically controlled BMIs with multiple forms of natural or surrogate sensory feedback.},

abstract = {Some neurones in macaque postarcuate premotor area modulate their firing frequency in relation to motor tasks which require visual information. We previously reported that a large proportion of these neurones modulate during execution of a detour reaching task in which the movement phase was separated in time from the phase in which the monkey received a visual cue for the movement required to retrieve a food reward. A large proportion of task-related neurones (75{\%}) modulated during this 'visual' phase, in which no task-related movements were made. This modulation was related to the position of the food reward, which served as the visual cue. Most of these neurones were located in cortical area 6, close to the arcuate curvature and its spur, but also more caudally in area 4 and rostrally in area 8. In the present chronic recording experiments in monkeys, several variations of the original task were used in order to test whether the 'visual'-related neuronal modulation could be involved in preparation of the upcoming movement. This modulation is unlikely to be related to any eye or arm movements occurring during the visual phase or to changes in environmental illumination. Neither can it be related to the presence of the visual cue in a particular part of the visual field, since the pattern of neuronal modulation was similar when a cue with a fixed position was used. This modulation was, however, contingent upon the occurrence of food retrieval during the subsequent 'movement phase', since it was abolished or diminished during presentation of a 'food-reward' which the monkey did not retrieve. For several neurones, modulation pattern during the visual phase depended on whether the food reward was to be retrieved with a gross hand movement or with relatively independent finger movements. It is likely, therefore, that neurones in the postarcuate premotor cortex are involved in preparation for arm movements with the help of visual cues. The results are discussed in view of corticocortical pathways which might be involved in transmission of visual information from visual areas through parietal association areas and premotor cortex to the primary motor cortex. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {A central goal of neuroscience is to determine how the brain's relatively static anatomy can support dynamic cortical function, i.e., cortical function that varies according to task demands. In pursuit of this goal, scientists have produced a large number of experimental results and established influential conceptual frameworks, in particular communication-through-coherence (CTC) and gating-by-inhibition (GBI), but these data and frameworks have not provided a parsimonious view of the principles that underlie cortical function. Here I synthesize these existing experimental results and the CTC and GBI frameworks, and propose the function-through-biased-oscillations (FBO) hypothesis as a model to understand dynamic cortical function. The FBO hypothesis suggests that oscillatory voltage amplitude is the principal measurement that directly reflects cortical excitability, that asymmetries in voltage amplitude explain a range of brain signal phenomena, and that predictive variations in such asymmetric oscillations provide a simple and general model for information routing that can help to explain dynamic cortical function.},

With the parallel evolution of neuroscience, engineering, and rapid computing, the era of clinical neuroprosthetics is approaching as a practical reality for people with severe motor impairment. Patients with such diseases as spinal cord injury, stroke, limb loss, and neuromuscular disorders may benefit through the implantation of these brain computer interfaces that serve to augment their ability to communicate and interact with their environment. In the upcoming years, it will be important for the neurosurgeon to understand what a brain computer interface is, its fundamental principle of operation, and what the salient surgical issues are when considering implantation.

abstract = {(1) There are data on the amount of current necessary to stimulate a myelinated fiber or cell body and/or its axon a given distance away from a monopolar electrode over the entire range of practical interest for intracranial stimulation. Data do not exist for other electrode configurations. (2) Currents from a monopolar cathode of more than 8 times threshold may block action potentials in axons. Therefore, only axons lying in a shell around the electrode are stimulated. Elements very close to the electrode may not be stimulated. Close to an electrode small diameter axons may be stimulated and larger ones may not be. (3) Most, and perhaps all, CNS myelinated fibers have chronaxies of 50-100 musec. When gray matter is stimulated, the chronaxie is often 200-700 musec. It is not clear what is being stimulated in this case. Current-duration relations should be determined for many more responses. (4) There are no current-distance or current-duration data for central finely myelinated or unmyelinated fibers. (5) It takes less cathodal current than anodal to stimulate a myelinated fiber passing by a monopolar electrode. When a monopolar electrode is near a cell body, on the opposite side from the axon, often the lowest threshold is anodal, but sometimes cathodal. Stimulation of a neuron near its cell body is not well understood, but in many cases the axon is probably stimulated. (6) Orientation of cell body and axons with respect to current flow is important. For an axon it is the component of the voltage gradient parallel to the fiber that is important. (7) The pia has a significant resistance and capacitance. Gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid have different resistivities, which affect patterns of current flow. (8) More is known about stimulation of mammalian CNS than most workers are aware of. Much of what is unknown seems solvable with current methods.},

Following upper extremity amputation, magnetic source imaging revealed that tactile stimulation of the lip evoked responses not only in the area of the somatosensory cortex corresponding to the face, but also within the cortical region that would normally correspond to the now absent hand. This "invasion" of the cortical amputation zone was accompanied by a significant increase in the size of the representation of the digits of the intact hand, presumably as a result of an increased importance of sensory stimulation consequent to increased dependence on that hand imposed by the loss of the contralateral extremity.},

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION An international consortium of experts organized, reviewed the literature, and attended the workshop. Topics were introduced at the workshop, followed by group discussion. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS A draft of a consensus statement was presented and further edited after plenary debate. The final statements were agreed on by all members. CONCLUSIONS (1) Patients with PD without significant active cognitive or psychiatric problems who have medically intractable motor fluctuations, intractable tremor, or intolerance of medication adverse effects are good candidates for DBS. (2) Deep brain stimulation surgery is best performed by an experienced neurosurgeon with expertise in stereotactic neurosurgery who is working as part of a interprofessional team. (3) Surgical complication rates are extremely variable, with infection being the most commonly reported complication of DBS. (4) Deep brain stimulation programming is best accomplished by a highly trained clinician and can take 3 to 6 months to obtain optimal results. (5) Deep brain stimulation improves levodopa-responsive symptoms, dyskinesia, and tremor; benefits seem to be long-lasting in many motor domains. (6) Subthalamic nuclei DBS may be complicated by increased depression, apathy, impulsivity, worsened verbal fluency, and executive dysfunction in a subset of patients. (7) Both globus pallidus pars interna and subthalamic nuclei DBS have been shown to be effective in addressing the motor symptoms of PD. (8) Ablative therapy is still an effective alternative and should be considered in a select group of appropriate patients.},

abstract = {Objective. Present day cortical brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) have made impressive advances using decoded brain signals to control extracorporeal devices. Although BMIs are used in a closed-loop fashion, sensory feedback typically is visual only. However medical case studies have shown that the loss of somesthesis in a limb greatly reduces the agility of the limb even when visual feedback is available. Approach. To overcome this limitation, this study tested a closed-loop BMI that utilizes intracortical microstimulation to provide ‘tactile' sensation to a non-human primate. Main result. Using stimulation electrodes in Brodmann area 1 of somatosensory cortex (BA1) and recording electrodes in the anterior intraparietal area, the parietal reach region and dorsal area 5 (area 5d), it was found that this form of feedback can be used in BMI tasks. Significance. Providing somatosensory feedback has the poyential to greatly improve the performance of cognitive neuroprostheses especially for fine control and object manipulation. Adding stimulation to a BMI system could therefore improve the quality of life for severely paralyzed patients.},

Describe the study design for the Everest Clinical Trial, a randomized single-blinded pivotal device trial, testing safety and efficacy of epidural CS delivered during rehabilitation for upper limb motor function in patients with ischemic stroke. Method . A total of 174 participants from 21 centers with hemiplegia at least 4 months after acute ischemic stroke are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to investigational or control groups. Investigational patients undergo implantation of cortical electrode and pulse generator and receive 6 weeks of upper limb rehabilitation with subthreshold CS delivered only during therapy.

Primary outcome measures include the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) score and the arm motor ability test (AMAT) measured at baseline and 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks following rehabilitation treatment with primary endpoint at 4 weeks following treatment. A successful outcome is defined as an improvement in UEFM of at least 4.5 points and in AMAT of at least 0.21 points from baseline to primary endpoint. A 20{\%} better success rate between investigational and control groups will be considered clinically meaningful. Adverse events occurring during the study will be identified. Results.

Neuronal responses in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during the instructed-delay period (IDP) between the CUE and subsequent GO signals are presumed to reflect early planning stages initiated by the prior information. In contrast, in multiple-choice reaction-time (RT) tasks, all motor planning and execution processes must occur after the GO signal. These assumptions predict that neuronal planning correlates recorded during the IDP of ID trials should share common features with early post-GO activity in RT trials, and that those response components need not be recapitulated after the GO signal of ID trials. These two predictions were tested by comparing activity recorded in RT and ID tasks from 503 neurons in PMd and caudal (MIc) and rostral (MIr) primary motor cortex. The incidence and strength of directionally tuned IDP activity declined progressively from PMd to MIc. The directional tuning of activity during the IDP of ID trials was more similar to that in the reaction-time epoch (RTE) of RT trials than after movement onset, especially in PMd. A modulation of post-GO activity was often observed between RT and ID trials and was confined mainly to the RTE. This effect was also most prominent in PMd. The most common change was a reduction in intensity of short-latency phasic responses to the GO signal between RT and ID trials, especially in PMd cells with a short-latency phasic response to CUE signals. However, the largest group of cells in each area showed no large change in peak RTE activity between RT and ID trials, whether they were active in the IDP or not. Since early phasic CUE-related responses are least likely to be recapitulated after the GO signal in ID trials, they may be a neuronal correlate of an early planning stage such as response selection. Tonic IDP responses, which are not as strongly associated with a post-GO reduction in activity, may be related to other aspects of motor planning and preparation. Finally, a major component of the movement-related activity in both MI and PMd is not susceptible to modification by prior information and is indivisibly coupled temporally to movement execution.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) often affects a person's ability to perform critical activities of daily living and can negatively affect his or her quality of life. Assistive technology aims to bridge this gap in order to augment function and increase independence. It is critical to involve consumers in the design and evaluation process as new technologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are developed. In a survey study of 57 veterans with SCI participating in the 2010 National Veterans Wheelchair Games, we found that restoration of bladder and bowel control, walking, and arm and hand function (tetraplegia only) were all high priorities for improving quality of life. Many of the participants had not used or heard of some currently available technologies designed to improve function or the ability to interact with their environment. The majority of participants in this study were interested in using a BCI, particularly for controlling functional electrical stimulation to restore lost function. Independent operation was considered to be the most important design criteria. Interestingly, many participants reported that they would consider surgery to implant a BCI even though noninvasiveness was a high-priority design requirement. This survey demonstrates the interest of individuals with SCI in receiving and contributing to the design of BCIs.},

abstract = {Subdural cortical stimulation (SuCS) is an appealing method in the treatment of neurological disorders, and computational modeling studies of SuCS have been applied to determine the optimal design for electrotherapy. To achieve a better understanding of computational modeling on the stimulation effects of SuCS, the influence of anisotropic white matter conductivity on the activation of cortical neurons was investigated in a realistic head model. In this paper, we constructed pyramidal neuronal models (layers 3 and 5) that showed primary excitation of the corticospinal tract, and an anatomically realistic head model reflecting complex brain geometry. The anisotropic information was acquired from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) and then applied to the white matter at various ratios of anisotropic conductivity. First, we compared the isotropic and anisotropic models; compared to the isotropic model, the anisotropic model showed that neurons were activated in the deeper bank during cathodal stimulation and in the wider crown during anodal stimulation. Second, several popular anisotropic principles were adapted to investigate the effects of variations in anisotropic information. We observed that excitation thresholds varied with anisotropic principles, especially with anodal stimulation. Overall, incorporating anisotropic conductivity into the anatomically realistic head model is critical for accurate estimation of neuronal responses; however, caution should be used in the selection of anisotropic information.},

abstract = {Perceiving temporal relationships between sensory events is a key process for recognising dynamic environments. Temporal order judgement (TOJ) and simultaneity judgement (SJ) are used for probing this perceptual process. TOJ and SJ exhibit identical psychometric parameters. However, there is accumulating psychophysical evidence that distinguishes TOJ from SJ. Some studies have proposed that the perceptual processes for SJ (e.g., detecting successive/simultaneity) are also included in TOJ, whereas TOJ requires more processes (e.g., determination of the temporal order). Other studies have proposed two independent processes for TOJ and SJ. To identify differences in the neural activity associated with TOJ versus SJ, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging of participants during TOJ and SJ with identical tactile stimuli. TOJ-specific activity was observed in multiple regions (e.g., left ventral and bilateral dorsal premotor cortices and left posterior parietal cortex) that overlap the general temporal prediction network for perception and motor systems. SJ-specific activation was observed only in the posterior insular cortex. Our results suggest that TOJ requires more processes than SJ and that both TOJ and SJ implement specific process components. The neural differences between TOJ and SJ thus combine features described in previous psychophysical hypotheses that proposed different mechanisms.},

abstract = {Both electrical microstimulation (EMS) and direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the brain are used to perform functional brain mapping. EMS is applied to animal fundamental neuroscience experiments, whereas DES is performed in the operating theatre on neurosurgery patients. The objective of the present review was to shed new light on electrical stimulation techniques in brain mapping by comparing EMS and DES. There is much controversy as to whether the use of DES during wide-awake surgery is the 'gold standard' for studying the brain function. As part of this debate, it is sometimes wrongly assumed that EMS and DES induce similar effects in the nervous tissues and have comparable behavioural consequences. In fact, the respective stimulation parameters in EMS and DES are clearly different. More surprisingly, there is no solid biophysical rationale for setting the stimulation parameters in EMS and DES; this may be due to historical, methodological and technical constraints that have limited the experimental protocols and prompted the use of empirical methods. In contrast, the gap between EMS and DES highlights the potential for new experimental paradigms in electrical stimulation for functional brain mapping. In view of this gap and recent technical developments in stimulator design, it may now be time to move towards alternative, innovative protocols based on the functional stimulation of peripheral nerves (for which a more solid theoretical grounding exists).},

abstract = {Brain surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings can investigate human brain electrophysiology at the cortical surface with exceptionally high signal to noise ratio and spatio-temporal resolution. To be able to use the high spatial resolution of ECoG for accurate brain function mapping and neurophysiology studies, the exact location of the ECoG electrodes on the brain surface should be known. Several issues complicate robust localization: surgical photographs of the electrode array made after implantation are often incomplete because the grids may be moved underneath the skull, beyond the exposed area. Computed tomography (CT) scans made after implantation will clearly localize electrodes, but the effects of surgical intervention may cause the exposed brain to move away from the skull and assume an unpredictable shape (the so-called brain shift). First, we present a method based on a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coregistered with a post-implantation CT scan to localize the electrodes and that automatically corrects for the brain shift by projecting the electrodes to the surface of the cortex. The calculated electrode positions are visualized on the individual subjects brain surface rendering. Second, the method was validated by comparison with surgical photographs, finding a median difference between photographic and calculated electrode centers-of-mass of only 2.6 mm, across 6 subjects. Third, to illustrate its utility we demonstrate how functional MRI and ECoG findings in the same subject may be directly compared in a simple motor movement experiment even when electrodes are not visible in the craniotomy. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In most of the in vivo electrophysiological studies of cortical processing, which are extracellular, the spike-triggered local field potential average (LFP STA) is the measure used to estimate the correlation between the synaptic inputs of individual neuron and the local population. To understand how the magnitude and shape of LFP STA reflect the underlying correlation of synaptic activities, the membrane potential of the firing neuron has to be recorded together with the LFP. Using intracellular recordings from the cortex of awake rats, we found that for a large range of firing rates and for different behavioral states, the LFP STA represents both in its waveform and its magnitude the cross-correlation between the membrane potential of the neuron and the LFP. This data, supported by further analysis, suggests that LFP STA does not represent large network events specific to the spike times, but rather the synchrony between the mean synaptic activity of the population and the membrane potential of the single neuron, present both around spike times and in the intervals between spikes. Furthermore, it introduces a novel interpretation of the available data from unit and LFP extracellular recording experiments.},

abstract = {Stimulation is extensively used in neuroscience research in diverse fields ranging from cognitive to clinical. Studying the effect of electrical and magnetic stimulation on neuronal activity is complicated by large stimulation-derived artifacts on the recording electrodes, which mask the spiking activity. Multiple studies have suggested a variety of solutions for the removal of artifacts and were typically directed at specific stimulation setups. In this study we introduce a generalized framework for stimulus artifacts removal, the Stimulus Artifact Removal Graphical Environment (SARGE). The framework provides an encapsulated environment for a multi-stage removal process, starting from the stimulus pulse detection, through estimation of the artifacts and their removal, and finally to signal reconstruction and the assessment of removal quality. The framework provides the user with subjective graphical and objective quantitative tools for assessing the resulting signal, and the ability to adjust the process to optimize the results. This extendable publicly available framework supports different types of stimulation, stimulation patterns and shapes, and a variety of artifact estimation methods. We exemplify the removal of artifacts generated by electrical micro- and macro-stimulation and magnetic stimulation and different stimulation protocols. The use of different estimation methods, such as averaging and function fitting is demonstrated, and the differences between them are discussed. Finally, the quality of removal is assessed and validated using quantitative measures and combined experimental-simulation studies. The framework marks a shift from " algorithm" and " data" centric approach to a " workflow" centric approach, thus introducing an innovative concept to the artifact removal process. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Cortical electrical stimulation (CES) techniques are practical tools in neurorehabilitation that are currently being used to test models of functional recovery after neurologic injury. However, the mechanisms by which CES has therapeutic effects, are not fully understood. Objective: In this study, we investigated the effects of CES on unit activity of different neuronal elements in layers of rat primary motor cortex after the offset of stimulation. We evaluated the effects of monopolar CES pulse polarity (anodic-first versus cathodic-first) using various stimulation frequencies and amplitudes on unit activity after stimulation. Methods: A penetrating single shank silicon microelectrode array enabled us to span the entirety of six layer motor cortex allowing simultaneous electrophysiologic recordings from different depths after monopolar CES. Neural spiking activity before the onset and after the offset of CES was modeled using point processes fit to capture neural spiking dynamics as a function of extrinsic stimuli based on generalized linear model methods. Results: We found that neurons in lower layers have a higher probability of being excited after anodic CES. Conversely, neurons located in upper cortical layers have a higher probability of being excited after cathodic stimulation. The opposing effects observed following anodic versus cathodic stimulation in upper and lower layers were frequency- and amplitude-dependent. Conclusions: The data demonstrates that the poststimulus changes in neural activity after manipulation of CES parameters changes according to the location (depth) of the recorded units in rat primary motor cortex. The most effective pulse polarity for eliciting action potentials after stimulation in lower layers was not as effective in upper layers. Likewise, lower amplitudes and frequencies of CES were more effective than higher amplitudes and frequencies for eliciting action potentials. These results have important implications in the context of maximizing efficacy of CES for neurorehabilitation and neuroprosthetic applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Classic in vitro studies have described spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at a synapse: the connection from neuron A to neuron B is strengthened (or weakened) when A fires before (or after) B within an optimal time window. Accordingly, more recent in vivo works have demonstrated behavioral effects consistent with an STDP mechanism; however, many relied on single-unit recordings. The ability to modify cortical connections becomes useful in the context of injury, when connectivity and associated behavior are compromised. To avoid the need for long-term, stable isolation of single units, one could control timed activation of two cortical sites with paired electrical stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that STDP could be induced via prolonged paired stimulation as quantified by cortical evoked potentials (EPs) in the sensorimotor cortex of awake, behaving monkeys. Paired simulation between two interconnected sites produced robust effects in EPs consistent with STDP, but only at 2/15 tested pairs. The stimulation protocol often produced increases in global network excitability or depression of the conditioned pair. Together, these results suggest that paired stimulation in vivo is a viable method to induce STDP between cortical populations, but that factors beyond activation timing must be considered to produce conditioning effects. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Plasticity of neural connections is important for development, learning, memory, and recovery from injury. Cellular mechanisms underlying spike-timing-dependent plasticity have been studied extensively in vitro . Recent in vivo work has demonstrated results consistent with the previously defined cellular mechanisms; however, the output measure in these studies was typically an indirect assessment of plasticity at the neural level. Here, we show direct plasticity in recordings of neuronal populations in awake, behaving nonhuman primates induced by paired electrical stimulation. In contrast to in vitro studies, we found that plastic effects were only produced between specific cortical areas. These findings suggest that similar mechanisms drive plasticity in vitro and in vivo , but that cortical architecture may contribute significantly to site-dependent effects.},

abstract = {For over a century, electrical microstimulation has been the most direct method for causally linking brain function with behavior. Despite this long history, it is still unclear how the activity of neural populations is affected by stimulation. For example, there is still no consensus on where activated cells lie or on the extent to which neural processes such as passing axons near the electrode are also activated. Past studies of this question have proven difficult because microstimulation interferes with electrophysiological recordings, which in any case provide only coarse information about the location of activated cells. We used two-photon calcium imaging, an optical method, to circumvent these hurdles. We found that microstimulation sparsely activates neurons around the electrode, sometimes as far as millimeters away, even at low currents. Our results indicate that the pattern of activated neurons likely arises from the direct activation of axons in a volume tens of microns in diameter.},

abstract = {The most widespread measures of human brain activity are the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal and surface field potential. Prior studies report a variety of relationships between these signals. To develop an understanding of how to interpret these signals and the relationship between them, we developed a model of (a) neuronal population responses and (b) transformations from neuronal responses into the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD signal and electrocorticographic (ECoG) field potential. Rather than seeking a transformation between the two measures directly, this approach interprets each measure with respect to the underlying neuronal population responses. This model accounts for the relationship between BOLD and ECoG data from human visual cortex in V1, V2, and V3, with the model predictions and data matching in three ways: across stimuli, the BOLD amplitude and ECoG broadband power were positively correlated, the BOLD amplitude and alpha power (8–13 Hz) were negatively correlated, and the BOLD amplitude and narrowband gamma power (30–80 Hz) were uncorrelated. The two measures provide complementary information about human brain activity, and we infer that features of the field potential that are uncorrelated with BOLD arise largely from changes in synchrony, rather than level, of neuronal activity.},

abstract = {In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb's rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.},

Subjects wore a dataglove that measured their hand aperture position and received one of three stimuli over the hand sensory cortex based on their current hand position as compared to a target aperture position. Using cortical stimulation feedback, subjects adjusted their hand aperture to move towards the target aperture region. One subject was able to achieve accuracies and R 2 values well above chance (best performance: R 2 = 0.93; accuracy = 0.76/1). Performance dropped during the catch trial (same stimulus independent of the position) to below chance levels, suggesting that the subject had been using the varied sensory feedback to modulate their motor behavior. To our knowledge, this study represents one of the first demonstrations of using direct cortical surface stimulation of the human sensory cortex to perform a motor task, and is a first step towards developing closed-loop human sensorimotor brain-computer interfaces.},

abstract = {Human neocortical 15–29-Hz beta oscillations are strong predictors of perceptual and motor performance. However, the mechanistic origin of beta in vivo is unknown, hindering understanding of its functional role. Combining human magnetoencephalography (MEG), computational modeling, and laminar recordings in animals, we present a new theory that accounts for the origin of spontaneous neocortical beta. In our MEG data, spontaneous beta activity from somatosensory and frontal cortex emerged as noncontinuous beta events typically lasting {\textless}150 ms with a stereotypical waveform. Computational modeling uniquely designed to infer the electrical currents underlying these signals showed that beta events could emerge from the integration of nearly synchronous bursts of ex-citatory synaptic drive targeting proximal and distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, where the defining feature of a beta event was a strong distal drive that lasted one beta period (∼50 ms). This beta mechanism rigorously accounted for the beta event pro-files; several other mechanisms did not. The spatial location of synaptic drive in the model to supragranular and infragranular layers was critical to the emergence of beta events and led to the prediction that beta events should be associated with a spe-cific laminar current profile. Laminar recordings in somatosensory neocortex from anesthetized mice and awake monkeys supported these predictions, suggesting this beta mechanism is conserved across species and recording modalities. These findings make sev-eral predictions about optimal states for perceptual and motor performance and guide causal interventions to modulate beta for optimal function. beta rhythm | magnetoencephalography | computational modeling | sensorimotor processing | Parkinson's disease B eta band rhythms (15–29 Hz) are a commonly observed ac-tivity pattern in the brain. They are found with magneto-encephalography (MEG) (1–4), EEG (5, 6), and local field potential (LFP) recordings from neocortex (7–9) and are pre-served across species (10). Local beta oscillations and their co-ordination between regions are implicated in numerous functions, including sensory perception, selective attention, and motor planning and initiation (2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11–15). Neocortical beta os-cillations are disrupted in various neuropathologies, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD), in which treatments that alleviate motor symptoms also reverse the neocortical beta disruption (16, 17). Although associations between beta and performance suggest a crucial role in brain function, beta rhythmicity might not be im-portant per se but instead may be an epiphenomenal consequence of other important processes. Discovering how beta emerges at the cellular and network levels is crucial to understanding why beta is such a clear predictor of performance in many domains. A major, unresolved point of debate concerns the locus of beta generation. One prominent view is that beta is generated in basal ganglia and thalamic structures and that neocortical beta is an entrained reflection of these inputs. Alternatively, beta may emerge within the neocortex as a consequence of internal dy-namics. An intermediate view, supported by the model presented here, is that beta emerges in the neocortex but is dependent on extrinsic synaptic drive that could originate from basal ganglia/ thalamus. Consistent with the first view, beta has been robustly observed in LFP signals from basal ganglia nuclei including the subthalamic nucleus, striatum, and globus pallidus (18, 19), and computational models have proposed mechanisms by which beta rhythms can emerge via interactions within and between these circuits (20, 21). Other studies have suggested that the neocortex itself has unique properties that generate beta rhythms through spike-mediated synaptic and electrical interactions within local circuits (22–25) or that beta in early-sensory neocortical areas could be driven in a top-down manner from frontal cortex during attentive states (26). Understanding the temporal and spectral nature of a specific beta signal is critical to uncovering its mechanism of generation and its role in the precise local circuit and context in which it is observed. A common view of beta " rhythms " is that they are sustained in time for many cycles, up to seconds in duration. The view of beta as a sustained rhythm is consistent with several papers that have reported what appears to be a continuous, high-power increase in beta activity, for example during a planning or},

Rats were pre-operatively trained on a skilled forelimb reaching task, the Montoya staircase test, and then received endothelin-1 induced ischemic lesions of the sensorimotor cortex. Ten to 14 days later, electrodes were implanted over the peri-lesion cortical surface. Rats subsequently began 10 days of rehabilitative training on the reaching task in 1 of 3 conditions: 1. 50 Hz stimulation during training, 2. 250 Hz stimulation during training or 3. no stimulation. No significant difference in performance was found between the 250 Hz and no stimulation groups. The 50 Hz stimulation group had significantly greater rates of improvement with the impaired forelimb in comparison to 250 Hz and no stimulation groups combined. Fifty Hz stimulated animals also had a significant increase in the surface density of dendritic processes immunoreactive for the cytoskeletal protein, microtubule-associated protein 2, in the peri-lesion cortex compared to the other groups. These results support the efficacy of combining rehabilitative training with cortical electrical stimulation to improve functional outcome and cortical neuronal structural plasticity following sensorimotor cortical damage.},

abstract = {Using microstimulation to imprint meaningful activity patterns into intrinsically highly interconnected neuronal substrates is hampered by activation of fibers of passage leading to a spatiotemporal "blur" of activity. The focus of the present study was to characterize the shape of this blur in the neocortex to arrive at an estimate of the resolution with which signals can be transmitted by multielectrode stimulation. The horizontal spread of significant unit activity evoked by near-threshold focal electrical stimulation (charge transfer 0.8-4.8 nC) and multielectrode recording in the face representation of the primary somatosensory cortex of ketamine anesthetized rats was determined to be about 1,350 microm. The evoked activity inside this range consisted in a sequence of fast excitatory response followed by an inhibition lasting {\textgreater}100 ms. These 2 responses could not be separated by varying the intensity of stimulation while a slow excitatory rebound after the inhibitory response was restricted to higher stimulus intensities ({\textgreater}2.4 nC). Stimulation frequencies of 20 and 40 Hz evoked repetitive excitatory response standing out against a continuous background of inhibition. At 5- and 10-Hz stimulation, the inhibitory response showed a complex interaction pattern attributed to highly sublinear superposition of individual inhibitory responses. The present data help to elucidate the neuronal underpinnings of behavioral effects of microstimulation. Furthermore, they provide essential information to determine spatiotemporal constraints for purposeful multielectrode stimulation in the neocortex.},

Although we understand several aspects of electrical stimulation at the cellular level, surface DES evokes a complex summation effect in a large volume of brain tissue, and the effect is difficult to predict as it depends on many local and remote physiological and morphological factors. The complex stimulation effects are reflected in the heterogeneity of behavioural effects that are induced by DES, which range from evocation to inhibition of responses - sometimes even when DES is applied at the same cortical site. Thus, it is a misconception that DES - in contrast to other neuroscience techniques - allows us to draw unequivocal conclusions about the role of stimulated brain areas.},

@article{Kudela2015,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE Computational modeling studies were performed to identify presynaptic elements of cortical neurons that are activated by subdural electrical stimulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS The computer model consists of layers of multicompartmental neurons arranged in 3D space in an anatomically realistic fashion inside a 4.8 × 4.8 × 3.4 mm volume of gray matter modeled as a homogenous and isotropic medium. The model was subjected to an electric field generated by a circular disk electrode. RESULTS The initiation of presynaptic action potentials (PAPs) in neurons takes place predominantly in the axon initial segment (AIS) or ectopically in axonal branch terminals. PAPs that were initiated in only one axonal terminal were typically followed by a second PAP (spike duplet) resulting from the activation of the AIS by the antidromically propagating initial PAP. There were significant time delays (up to 0.5 ms) in the propagation of these ectopically initiated PAPs along the axons to nonactivated axonal branches and, associated with these delays, latencies in the occurrence of spike duplets in different axonal terminals. The effect of the dendritic arbor 3D structure on the AIS activation threshold was contingent on whether the net axonal and somato-dendritic current flows made an antagonistic or synergetic contribution. CONCLUSIONS This study examines the effects of subdural electrical stimulation on a high-density network consisting of several populations of multicompartment cell types. The effect of dendritic arbor structure on the axonal activation threshold is prominent in the case of multipolar neurons with large-diameter symmetric dendrites (basal/apical) that are oriented parallel to the electric field lines. The timing of presynaptic terminal activation after stimulation is not determined solely by the axonal delay (orthodromic propagation) but depends on the details of the applied stimulation field and axonal branching structure, which may be important factors in characterizing the effects of electrical stimulation in neuromodulation systems.},

abstract = {The electrical conductivity of solid-state matter is a fundamental physical property and can be precisely derived from the resistance measured via the four-point probe technique excluding contributions from parasitic contact resistances. Over time, this method has become an interdisciplinary characterization tool in materials science, semiconductor industries, geology, physics, etc, and is employed for both fundamental and application-driven research. However, the correct derivation of the conductivity is a demanding task which faces several difficulties, e.g. the homogeneity of the sample or the isotropy of the phases. In addition, these sample-specific characteristics are intimately related to technical constraints such as the probe geometry and size of the sample. In particular, the latter is of importance for nanostructures which can now be probed technically on very small length scales. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the four-point probe technique, introduced by FrankWenner, in this review we revisit and discuss various correction factors which are mandatory for an accurate derivation of the resistivity from the measured resistance. Among others, sample thickness, dimensionality, anisotropy, and the relative size and geometry of the sample with respect to the contact assembly are considered. We are also able to derive the correction factors for 2D anisotropic systems on circular finite areas with variable probe spacings. All these aspects are illustrated by state-of-the-art experiments carried out using a four-tip STM/SEM system. We are aware that this review article can only cover some of the most important topics. Regarding further aspects, e.g. technical realizations, the influence of inhomogeneities or different transport regimes, etc, we refer to other review articles in this field},

However, it is not clear how the cortical anatomy or the polarity and position of the electrode affects current flow and neural activation in the cortex. We developed a 3D computational model simulating ECS over the precentral gyrus. With the electrode placed directly above the gyrus, about half of the stimulus current flowed through the crown of the gyrus while current density was low along the banks deep in the sulci. Beneath the electrode, neurons oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface were depolarized by anodic stimulation, and neurons oriented parallel to the boundary were depolarized by cathodic stimulation. Activation was localized to the crown of the gyrus, and neurons on the banks deep in the sulci were not polarized. During regulated voltage stimulation, the magnitude of the activating function was inversely proportional to the thickness of the CSF and dura. During regulated current stimulation, the activating function was not sensitive to the thickness of the dura but was slightly more sensitive than during regulated voltage stimulation to the thickness of the CSF. Varying the width of the gyrus and the position of the electrode altered the distribution of the activating function due to changes in the orientation of the neurons beneath the electrode. Bipolar stimulation, although often used in clinical practice, reduced spatial selectivity as well as selectivity for neuron orientation.},

abstract = {Background: Neuronal plasticity is the physiological correlate of learning and memory. In animal experiments, synaptic (i.e. long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD)) and intrinsic plasticity are distinguished. In human motor cortex, cortical plasticity can be demonstrated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Changes in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes most likely represent synaptic plasticity and are thus termed LTP-like and LTD-like plasticity. Objective/hypothesis: We investigated the role of changes of motor threshold and their relation to changes of MEP amplitudes. Methods: We induced plasticity by paired associative stimulation (PAS) with 25 ms or 10 ms inter-stimulus interval or by motor practice (MP) in 64 healthy subjects aged 18-31 years (median 24.0). Results: We observed changes of MEP amplitudes and motor threshold after PAS[25], PAS[10] and MP. In all three protocols, long-term individual changes in MEP amplitude were inversely correlated to changes in motor threshold (PAS[25]: P = .003, n = 36; PAS[10]: P = .038, n = 19; MP: P = .041, n = 19). Conclusion: We conclude that changes of MEP amplitudes and MT represent two indices of motor cortex plasticity. Whereas increases and decreases in MEP amplitude are assumed to represent LTP-like or LTD-like synaptic plasticity of motor cortex output neurons, changes of MT may be considered as a correlate of intrinsic plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we pooled original data from nine PAS studies from three centers and analyzed the combined dataset of 190 healthy subjects with regard to age dependency, the role of stimulation parameters and the effect of different statistical methods. We observed no main effect of the PAS intervention over all studies (F(2;362) = 0.44; p = 0.644). The rate of subjects showing the expected increase of motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes was 53{\%}. The PAS effect differed significantly between studies as shown by a significant interaction effect (F(16;362) = 1.77; p = 0.034) but post-hoc testing did not reveal significant effects after correction for multiple tests. There was a trend toward increased variability of the PAS effect in older subjects. Acquisition parameters differed across studies but without systematically influencing changes in MEP-size. The use of post/baseline quotients systematically indicated stronger PAS effects than post/baseline difference or the logarithm of the post/baseline quotient. The non-significant PAS effects across studies and a wide range of responder rates between studies indicate a high variability of this method. We were thus not able to replicate findings from a previous meta-analysis showing robust effects of PAS. No pattern emerged regarding acquisition parameters that at this point could guide future studies to reduce variability and help increase response rate. For future studies, we propose to report the responder rate and recommend the use of the logarithmized post/baseline quotient for further analyses to better address the possibility that results are driven by few extreme cases.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) with targets such as the subthalamic nucleus or the pallidum were found to be beneficial in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The investigation of the mechanisms of action of DBS by recording concomitant neural activities in basal ganglia is hampered by the large stimulus artefacts (SA). Approaches to remove the SA with conventional filters, or other conventional digital methods, are not always effective due to the significant overlap between the spectral contents of the neuronal signal and the SA. Thus, such approaches may produce a significant residual SA or alter the neuronal signal dynamics by removing its frequency contents. In this work, we propose a method based on an on-line SA template extraction and on the Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to automatically detect and remove the dynamics of the SA without altering the embedded dynamics of the neuronal signal during stimulation. The results, based on real signals recorded in the subthalamic nucleus during Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) experiments, show that this technique, which may be applied on-line, effectively identifies, separates and removes the SA, and uncovers neuronal potentials superimposed on the artefact. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Language functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used extensively in the past decade for both clinical and research purposes. Its integration in the preoperative imaging assessment of brain lesions involving eloquent areas is progressively more diffused in neurosurgical practice. Nevertheless, the reliability of language fMRI is unclear. To understand the reliability of preoperative language fMRI in patients operated on for brain tumors, the surgical studies that compared language fMRI with direct cortical stimulation (DCS) were reviewed. METHODS: Articles comparing language fMRI with DCS of language areas were reviewed with attention to the lesion pathology, the magnetic field, the language tasks used pre- and intraoperatively, and the validation modalities adopted to establish the reliability of language fMRI. We tried to explore the effectiveness of language fMRI in gliomas. RESULTS: Nine language brain mapping studies compared the findings of fMRI with those of DCS. The studies are not homogeneous for tumor types, magnetic fields, pre- and intraoperative language tasks, intraoperative matching criteria, and results. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated in 5 studies (respectively ranging from 59{\%} to 100{\%} and from 0{\%} to 97{\%}). CONCLUSION: The contradictory results of these studies do not allow consideration of language fMRI as an alternative tool to DCS in brain lesions located in language areas, especially in gliomas because of the pattern of growth of these tumors. However, language fMRI conducted with high magnet fields is a promising brain mapping tool that must be validated by DCS in methodological robust studies.},

abstract = {We present a mathematical model for calculating the electric field induced in the head during magnetic stimulation of the cortex. The electric field arises from 2 sources: (1) the changing magnetic field creates an electric field in the tissue by electromagnetic induction, and (2) a charge distribution arises on the surface of the head and produces its own electrostatic field. A 3-sphere model is used to represent the brain, skull and scalp. The electric field as a function of the coil position, shape and orientation is computed numerically. The charge distribution partially shields the brain from the stimulus. The electric field is insensitive to the skull conductivity, in contrast with electrical stimulation using surface electrodes. Different coil shapes and orientations are considered, and a figure-of-eight coil is shown to deliver the largest and most focal stimulus. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {In order to understand the complex functional organization of the motor system, it is essential to know the anatomical and functional connectivity among individual motor areas. Clinically, knowledge of these cortico-cortical connections is important to understand the rapid spread of epileptic discharges through the network underlying ictal motor manifestation. In humans, however, knowledge of neuronal in vivo connectivity has been limited. We recently reported a new method, 'cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP)', to electrically track the cortico-cortical connections by stimulating a part of the brain through subdural electrodes and recording the cortical evoked potentials that emanate from a distant region of the cortex via neuronal projections. We applied the CCEP methodology to investigate in vivo cortico-cortical connections between the lateral motor cortex [LMCx; sensorimotor (SM) and lateral premotor areas] and the medial motor cortex [MMCx; supplementary motor area proper (SMA), pre-SMA and foot SM]. Seven patients with intractable partial epilepsy were studied. These patients had chronic implantation of subdural electrodes covering part of the lateral and medial frontal areas. As a part of the routine pre-surgical evaluation, comprehensive cortical mapping was performed by electrical stimulation of the subdural electrodes, and the precise localization of the subdural electrodes was defined by MRI co-registration. Single-pulse electrical stimuli were delivered to MMCx (7 patients) and LMCx (4), and CCEPs time-locked to the stimuli were recorded by averaging electrocorticograms from LMCx and MMCx, respectively. Short-latency CCEPs were observed when stimulating MMCx and recording from LMCx (mean latency: 21.6 ms, range: 9-47 ms) and vice versa when stimulating LMCx and recording from MMCx (mean latency: 29.4 ms, range: 11-57 ms). In terms of the location of these stimulus sites and CCEP responses along the rostrocaudal axis, regression analysis revealed a consistent correlation between the sites of stimulation and maximum CCEP for stimulation of both MMCx and LMCx. Functionally, stimulation of the positive motor areas in MMCx elicited CCEPs at the somatotopically homologous regions in LMCx (71{\%}). The same findings were observed in MMCx (82{\%}) upon stimulation of LMCx. In four subjects in whom bi-directional connectivity was investigated by stimulating both MMCx and LMCx, reciprocality was observed in the majority of connections (78-94{\%}). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a human motor cortico-cortical network connecting (i) anatomically homologous areas of LMCx and MMCx along the rostrocaudal cognitive-motor gradient; and (ii) somatotopically homologous regions in LMCx and MMCx in a reciprocal manner.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical technique that has been widely applied for the treatment of tremor or motor symptoms associated with advanced Parkinson's disease. Large stimulus artifacts, however, have hampered investigations of physiological mechanisms underlying DBS effects using extracellular recording techniques. We have developed an off-line procedure for removing stimulus artifacts from recorded neuronal signals (monopolar) and applied this method of artifact subtraction to DBS studies using extracellular recording techniques in a nonhuman primate. The procedure consists of developing a template of the artifact by averaging the artifact signals triggered by its onset. The template is then subtracted from the individual triggered signals. The experimental results indicate that this method is highly effective in removing the majority of the stimulus artifact, while leaving recorded neuronal activity intact. In fact, removal of stimulation artifact using this technique has revealed a short-latency neuronal response to stimulation that was previously obscured by the stimulus artifact. Thus, this technique may not only improve the quality of electrophysiological studies employing DBS techniques, but may also help to elucidate neuronal mechanisms underlying the effect of DBS. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In 99 patients with mass lesions in and around the central region, the central sulcus was intraoperatively localized with the use of somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) phase reversal. In 33 of these patients, the motor cortex was directly stimulated and electromyographic responses were recorded from the forearm flexor, thenar, and hypothenar muscles. An additional 25 patients, with subcortical lesions or lesions directly located at the pyramidal tract, were continuously monitored during surgery by motor evoked potentials (MEPs). An exact determination of the central sulcus and tumor localization was possible in all patients; a phase reversal was obtained in 90.8{\%} of the patients, and localization was possible as a result of anatomic structures and the loss of N20 or P20 of SEPs in the other 9.2{\%}. MEPs were obtained in 32 of 33 patients and also in all 25 patients who underwent MEP monitoring at the beginning of tumor removal. From this study, it can be concluded that the combination of SEP phase reversal and modified electrical cortex stimulation is compatible with general anesthesia, although anesthesia was not systematically controlled according to a protocol. Although this study demonstrates that the combined SEP/MEP technique was feasible, it is not yet possible to demonstrate benefit in improving the outcome of patients. Concerning the safety of stimulation, the exact localization of the central sulcus by the noninvasive SEP method, compared with direct electrical stimulation, offered more safety for the patient. The modified technique of direct motor cortex stimulation needed much less charge density than did the common technique. The recording of electromyographic responses instead of movements made objective documentation possible, and the analysis of amplitudes and latencies will supply quantitative information about the motor system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND This prospective, single-blinded, multicenter study assessed the safety and efficacy of electrical epidural motor cortex stimulation (EECS) in improving upper limb motor function of ischemic stroke patients with moderate to moderately severe hemiparesis. METHODS Patients ≥4 months poststroke were randomized 2:1 to an investigational (n = 104) or control (n = 60) group, respectively. Investigational patients were implanted (n = 94) with an epidural 6-contact lead perpendicular to the primary motor cortex and a pulse generator. Both groups underwent 6 weeks of rehabilitation, but EECS was delivered to investigational patients during rehabilitation. The primary efficacy endpoint (PE) was defined as attaining a minimum improvement of 4.5 points in the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) scale as well as 0.21 points in the Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT) 4 weeks postrehabilitation. Follow-up assessments were performed 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks postrehabilitation. Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events (AEs) that occurred between enrollment and the end of rehabilitation. RESULTS Primary intent-to-treat analysis showed no group differences at 4 weeks, with PE being met by 32{\%} and 29{\%} of investigational and control patients, respectively (P = .36). Repeated-measures secondary analyses revealed no significant treatment group differences in mean UEFM or AMAT scores. However, post hoc comparisons showed that a greater proportion of investigational (39{\%}) than control (15{\%}) patients maintained or achieved PE (P = .003) at 24 weeks postrehabilitation. Investigational group mean AMAT scores also improved significantly (P {\textless} .05) when compared to the control group at 24 weeks postrehabilitation. Post hoc analyses also showed that 69{\%} (n = 9/13) of the investigational patients who elicited movement thresholds during stimulation testing met PE at 4 weeks, and mean UEFM and AMAT scores was also significantly higher (P {\textless} .05) in this subgroup at the 4-, 12-, and 24-week assessments when compared to the control group. Headache (19{\%}), pain (13{\%}), swelling (7{\%}), and infection (7{\%}) were the most commonly observed implant procedure-related AEs. Overall, there were 11 serious AEs in 9 investigational group patients (7 procedure related, 4 anesthesia related). CONCLUSIONS The primary analysis pertaining to efficacy of EECS during upper limb motor rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients was negative at 4 weeks postrehabilitation. A better treatment response was observed in a subset of patients eliciting stimulation induced upper limb movements during motor threshold assessments performed prior to each rehabilitation session. Post hoc comparisons indicated treatment effect differences at 24 weeks, with the control group showing significant decline in the combined primary outcome measure relative to the investigational group. These results have the potential to inform future chronic stroke rehabilitation trial design.},

abstract = {Electrical brain stimulation (EBS) is an emerging therapy for the treatment of neurological disorders, and computational modeling studies of EBS have been used to determine the optimal parameters for highly cost-effective electrotherapy. Recent notable growth in computing capability has enabled researchers to consider an anatomically realistic head model that represents the full head and complex geometry of the brain rather than the previous simplified partial head model (extruded slab) that represents only the precentral gyrus. In this work, subdural cortical stimulation (SuCS) was found to offer a better understanding of the differential activation of cortical neurons in the anatomically realistic full-head model than in the simplified partial-head models. We observed that layer 3 pyramidal neurons had comparable stimulation thresholds in both head models, while layer 5 pyramidal neurons showed a notable discrepancy between the models; in particular, layer 5 pyramidal neurons demonstrated asymmetry in the thresholds and action potential initiation sites in the anatomically realistic full-head model. Overall, the anatomically realistic full-head model may offer a better understanding of layer 5 pyramidal neuronal responses. Accordingly, the effects of using the realistic full-head model in SuCS are compelling in computational modeling studies, even though this modeling requires substantially more effort.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that the efficacy of neuronal connections is strengthened when there is a persistent causal relationship between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. Such activity-dependent plasticity may underlie the reorganization of cortical representations during learning, although direct in vivo evidence is lacking. Here we show that stable reorganization of motor output can be induced by an artificial connection between two sites in the motor cortex of freely behaving primates. An autonomously operating electronic implant used action potentials recorded on one electrode to trigger electrical stimuli delivered at another location. Over one or more days of continuous operation, the output evoked from the recording site shifted to resemble the output from the corresponding stimulation site, in a manner consistent with the potentiation of synaptic connections between the artificially synchronized populations of neurons. Changes persisted in some cases for more than one week, whereas the output from sites not incorporated in the connection was unaffected. This method for inducing functional reorganization in vivo by using physiologically derived stimulus trains may have practical application in neurorehabilitation after injury.},

Here we review all reported cases of TS DBS and provide updated recommendations for selection, assessment, and management of potential TS DBS cases based on the literature and implantation experience. Candidates should have a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM V) diagnosis of TS with severe motor and vocal tics, which despite exhaustive medical and behavioral treatment trials result in significant impairment. Deep brain stimulation should be offered to patients only by experienced DBS centers after evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. Rigorous preoperative and postoperative outcome measures of tics and associated comorbidities should be used. Tics and comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions should be optimally treated per current expert standards, and tics should be the major cause of disability. Psychogenic tics, embellishment, and malingering should be recognized and addressed. We have removed the previously suggested 25-year-old age limit, with the specification that a multidisciplinary team approach for screening is employed. A local ethics committee or institutional review board should be consulted for consideration of cases involving persons younger than 18 years of age, as well as in cases with urgent indications. Tourette syndrome patients represent a unique and complex population, and studies reveal a higher risk for post-DBS complications. Successes and failures have been reported for multiple brain targets; however, the optimal surgical approach remains unknown.

abstract = {The cerebral cortex forms a sheet of neurons organized into a network of interconnected modules that is highly expanded in humans and presumably enables our most refined sensory and cognitive abilities. The links of this network form a fundamental aspect of its organization, and a great deal of research is focusing on understanding how information flows within and between different regions. However, an often-overlooked element of this connectivity regards a causal, hierarchical structure of regions, whereby certain nodes of the cortical network may exert greater influence over the others. While this is difficult to ascertain non-invasively, patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring for epilepsy provide a unique window into this aspect of cortical organization. In this review, we highlight the potential for cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) mapping to directly measure neuronal propagation across large-scale brain networks with spatio-temporal resolution that is superior to traditional neuroimaging methods. We first introduce effective connectivity and discuss the mechanisms underlying CCEP generation. Next, we highlight how CCEP mapping has begun to provide insight into the neural basis of non-invasive imaging signals. Finally, we present a novel approach to perturbing and measuring brain network function during cognitive processing. The direct measurement of CCEPs in response to electrical stimulation represents a potentially powerful clinical and basic science tool for probing the large-scale networks of the human cerebral cortex.},
annote = {This is a review paper summarizing the work in mapping human brain networks with cortico-cortical evoked potentials. The paper demonstrates the various applications of using CCEP mapping to measure neuronal propagation throughout the brain to examine brain networks with spatio-temporal resolution that is better than that possible by other methods (EEG, MRI). The review covers effective connectivity, the generation of CCEPs, how CCEPs may reveal information about non-invasive imaging, and prevents a novel method of using task-related CCEPs to alter brain networks during particular cognitive functions.},

abstract = {Synchronized phase estimates between oscillating neuronal signals at the macroscale level reflect coordinated activities between neuronal assemblies. Recent electrophysiological evidence suggests the presence of signifi-cant spontaneous phase synchrony within the resting state. The purpose of this study was to investigate phase synchrony, including directional interactions, in resting state subdural electrocorticographic recordings to better characterize patterns of regional phase interactions across the lateral cortical surface during the resting state. We estimated spontaneous phase locking value (PLV) as a measure of functional connectivity, and phase slope index (PSI) as a measure of pseudo-causal phase interactions, across a broad range of canonical frequency bands and the modulation of the amplitude envelope of high gamma (amHG), a band that is believed to best reflect the phys-iological processes giving rise to the functional magnetic resonance imaging BOLD signal. Long-distance inter-actions had higher PLVs in slower frequencies ({\pounds}theta) than in higher ones (beta) with amHG behaving more like slow frequencies, and a general trend of increasing frequency band of significant PLVs when moving across the lateral surface along an anterior–posterior axis. Moreover, there was a strong trend of frontal-to-parietal di-rectional phase synchronization, measured by PSI across multiple frequencies. These findings, which are likely indicative of coordinated and structured spontaneous cortical interactions, are important in the study of time scales and directional nature of resting state functional connectivity, and may ultimately contribute to a better understanding of how spontaneous synchrony is linked to variation in regional architecture across the lateral cor-tical surface.},

abstract = {Introduction: according to influential models, based on monkey anatomy, the parietal cortex modulates motor output in an indirect way, by interposition of the premotor cortex. Conversely, in humans, some data from non-invasive brain stimulation suggest that the parietal cortex could be at the origin of direct cortico-cortical connections to the primary motor cortex (M1). Here we assessed the feasibility of investigating parietalmotor cortico-cortical connectivity by means of direct cortical stimulation in intraoperative settings with a conventional "conditioning / test stimulus" paradigm. Methods: we tested a single subject undergoing brain surgery for excision of a meningioma localized in the right postcentral region. Surgery was performed during general anesthesia. Direct electrical cortical stimulation was applied toM1 (test stimuli) in trains of 4 stimuli at 250 Hz. while EMG recordings were made from distal upper limb muscles. In some trials, a brief train of two pulses at 250 Hz (conditioning stimulus) was delivered on the cortical surface along the intraparietal sulcus at 5 different positions separated by 1 cm, immediately prior to motor stimulation. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to conditioning stimuli alone, to test stimuli alone and to coupled conditioning and test stimuli, were recorded and compared. Results: stimulation of the intraparietal sulcus alone did not produce any MEP in any of the 5 spots. Stimulation of M1 alone produced stable MEPs. Conditioned M1 stimulation produced significantly smaller MEPs when parietal stimulation was applied to a specific spot, 1 cm posterior to the junction between the IPS and the postcentral sulcus. Conclusions: our preliminary data suggest that cortico-cortical connectivity can be tested with direct cortical stimulation. The data in our single subject seem to favor the hypothesis of direct connections between the cortex associated with the IPS and M1, though further investigations on a broader number of subjects are required.},

@article{Sliwinska2014,
abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe, non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses a strong electromagnet in order to temporarily disrupt information processing in a brain region, generating a short-lived "virtual lesion." Stimulation that interferes with task performance indicates that the affected brain region is necessary to perform the task normally. In other words, unlike neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that indicate correlations between brain and behavior, TMS can be used to demonstrate causal brain-behavior relations. Furthermore, by varying the duration and onset of the virtual lesion, TMS can also reveal the time course of normal processing. As a result, TMS has become an important tool in cognitive neuroscience. Advantages of the technique over lesion-deficit studies include better spatial-temporal precision of the disruption effect, the ability to use participants as their own control subjects, and the accessibility of participants. Limitations include concurrent auditory and somatosensory stimulation that may influence task performance, limited access to structures more than a few centimeters from the surface of the scalp, and the relatively large space of free parameters that need to be optimized in order for the experiment to work. Experimental designs that give careful consideration to appropriate control conditions help to address these concerns. This article illustrates these issues with TMS results that investigate the spatial and temporal contributions of the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) to reading.},

abstract = {Objective: To provide an analysis of stimulation parameters for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Methods: Synthesis of theoretical and empirical findings is used to provide guidance for the selection of stimulus parameters. Finite element modeling is used to investigate the effects of contact location and electrode geometry on the electric field, and to estimate the effects of current density distribution on the limit for non-damaging stimulation. Results: Anatomical targeting of DBS electrodes is complicated by the uncertainty of which neural elements are targeted and differences in the electric field distribution in fiber tracts and nuclei. Electrical targeting by selection of electrode geometry and stimulus waveform can alter the distribution of the electric field and control neural activation. The recommended charge density limit for DBS represents a liberal estimate for non-damaging stimulation. Short duration stimulus pulses reduce charge injection and increase the therapeutic window between therapeutic effects and side effects. Conclusions: There are several challenges to developing rational methods of selecting stimulus parameters including a large number of degrees of freedom, the unknown effects of stimulation, and the complexity of the responses. Significance: Understanding the fundamentals of electrical stimulation of the nervous system enables rational selection of stimulus parameters. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder affecting {\~{}}1-2{\%} of the population. Despite the available treatment options (pharmacotherapy, surgery, and vagus nerve stimulation), a large percentage of patients continue to have seizures. With the success of deep brain stimulation for treatment of movement disorders, brain stimulation has received renewed attention as a potential treatment option for epilepsy. Responsive stimulation aims to suppress epileptiform activity by delivering stimulation directly in response to electrographic activity. Animal and human data support the concept that responsive stimulation can abort epileptiform activity, and this modality may be a safe and effective treatment option for epilepsy. Responsive stimulation has the advantage of specificity. In contrast to the typically systemic administration of pharmacotherapy, with the concomitant possibility of side effects, electrical stimulation can be targeted to the specific brain regions involved in the seizure. In addition, responsive stimulation provides temporal specificity. Treatment is provided as needed, potentially reducing the likelihood of functional disruption or habituation due to continuous treatment. Here we review current animal and human research in responsive brain stimulation for epilepsy and then discuss the NeuroPace RNS System, an investigational implantable responsive neurostimulator system that is being evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded trial to assess the safety and efficacy of responsive stimulation for the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.},

abstract = {Objective: Standard coils used in research and the clinic for noninvasive magnetic stimulation of the human brain are not capable of stimulating deep brain regions directly. As the fields induced by these coils decrease rapidly as a function of depth, only very high intensities would allow functional stimulation of deep brain regions and such intensities would lead to undesirable side effects. We have designed a coil based on numerical simulations and phantom brain measurements that allows stimulation of deeper brain regions, termed the Hesed coil (H-coil). In the present study we tested the efficacy and some safety aspects of the H-coil on healthy volunteers. Methods: The H-coil was compared to a regular figure-8 coil in 6 healthy volunteers by measuring thresholds for activation of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) representation in the motor cortex as a function of distance from each of the coils. Results: The rate of decrease in the coil intensity as a function of distance is markedly slower for the H-coil. The motor cortex could be activated by the H-coil at a distance of 5.5 cm compared to 2 cm with the figure-8 coil. Conclusions: The present study indicate that the H-coil is likely to have the ability of deep brain stimulation and without the need of increasing the intensity to extreme levels that would cause a much greater stimulation in cortical regions. Significance: The ability of non-invasive deep brain stimulation potentially opens a wide range of both research and therapeutic applications. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Tactile feedback is critical to grip and object manipulation. Its absence results in reliance on visual and auditory cues. Our objective was to assess the effect of sensory feedback on task performance in individuals with limb loss.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH: Stimulation of the peripheral nerves using implanted cuff electrodes provided two subjects with sensory feedback with intensity proportional to forces on the thumb, index, and middle fingers of their prosthetic hand during object manipulation. Both subjects perceived the sensation on their phantom hand at locations corresponding to the locations of the forces on the prosthetic hand. A bend sensor measured prosthetic hand span. Hand span modulated the intensity of sensory feedback perceived on the thenar eminence for subject 1 and the middle finger for subject 2. We performed three functional tests with the blindfolded subjects. First, the subject tried to determine whether or not a wooden block had been placed in his prosthetic hand.

This avoids subjective evaluation of microstructural differences which has so far been the only way to structurally define cortical areas. Ten brains were fixed in formalin or Bodian's fixative, embedded in paraffin, sectioned as a whole in the coronal plane at 20 microm, and cell stained. Cell bodies were segmented from the background by adaptive thresholding. Equidistant density profiles (125 microm wide, spacing 300 or 150 microm) were extracted perpendicularly to the pial surface across cortical layers II-VI and processed with multivariate statistical procedures. Positions of significant differences in shape between adjacent groups of profiles were correlated with the cytoarchitectonic pattern. Statistically significant borders can be reproduced at corresponding positions across a series of nearby sections. They match visible changes in cytoarchitecture in the cell-stained sections. Area 3a lies in the fundus of the central sulcus, and area 3b in the rostral bank of the postcentral gyrus. Area 1 lies on its crown and reaches down into the postcentral sulcus. Interareal borders, however, do not match macrostructural landmarks of the postcentral gyrus, and they considerably vary in their positions relative to these landmarks across different brains. Hence, only genuine microstructural analysis can define the borders between these cortical areas. Additional significant borders which do not correlate with visible changes in cytoarchitecture can be found within areas 3b and 1. They may represent somatotopy and/or cortical representations of different somatosensory receptors.},

To investigate the underlying mechanisms we induced targeted reorganization of motor output effects by establishing an artificial recurrent connection between a forelimb muscle and an unrelated site in the primary motor cortex (M1) of macaques. A head-fixed computer transformed forelimb electromyographic activity into proportional subthreshold intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) during hours of unrestrained volitional behavior. This conditioning paradigm stimulated the cortical site for a particular muscle in proportion to activation of another muscle and induced robust site- and input-specific reorganization of M1 output effects. Reorganization was observed within 25 min and could be maintained with intermittent conditioning for successive days. Control stimulation that was independent of muscle activity, termed "pseudoconditioning," failed to produce reorganization. Preconditioning output effects were gradually restored during volitional behaviors following the end of conditioning. The ease of changing the relationship between cortical sites and associated muscle responses suggests that under normal conditions these relations are maintained through physiological feedback loops. These findings demonstrate that motor cortex outputs may be reorganized in a targeted and sustainable manner through artificial afferent feedback triggered from controllable and readily recorded muscle activity. Such cortical reorganization has implications for therapeutic treatment of neurological injuries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Analysis of intra- and perioperatively recorded cortical and basal ganglia local field potentials in human movement disorders has provided great insight into the pathophysiology of diseases such as Parkinson's, dystonia, and essential tremor. However, in order to better understand the network abnormalities and effects of chronic therapeutic stimulation in these disorders, long-term recording from a fully implantable data collection system is needed. APPROACH: A fully implantable investigational data collection system, the Activa{\textregistered} PC + S neurostimulator (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), has been developed for human use. Here, we tested its utility for extended intracranial recording in the motor system of a nonhuman primate. The system was attached to two quadripolar paddle arrays: one covering sensorimotor cortex, and one covering a proximal forelimb muscle, to study simultaneous cortical field potentials and electromyography during spontaneous transitions from rest to movement. MAIN RESULTS: Over 24 months of recording, movement-related changes in physiologically relevant frequency bands were readily detected, including beta and gamma signals at approximately 2.5 $\mu$V/[Formula: see text] and 0.7 $\mu$V/[Formula: see text], respectively. The system architecture allowed for flexible recording configurations and algorithm triggered data recording. In the course of physiological analyses, sensing artifacts were observed (∼1 $\mu$Vrms stationary tones at fixed frequency), which were mitigated either with post-processing or algorithm design and did not impact the scientific conclusions. Histological examination revealed no underlying tissue damage; however, a fibrous capsule had developed around the paddles, demonstrating a potential mechanism for the observed signal amplitude reduction. SIGNIFICANCE: This study establishes the usefulness of this system in measuring chronic brain and muscle signals. Use of this system may potentially be valuable in human trials of chronic brain recording in movement disorders, a next step in the design of closed-loop neurostimulation paradigms.},

abstract = {How does human brain stimulation result in lasting changes in cortical excitability? Uncertainty on this question hinders the development of personalized brain stimulation therapies. To characterize how cortical excitability is altered by stimulation, we applied repetitive direct electrical stimulation in eight human subjects (male and female) undergoing intracranial monitoring. We evaluated single-pulse corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) before and after repetitive stimulation across prefrontal (N=4), temporal (N=1), and motor (N=3) cortices. We asked if a single session of repetitive stimulation was sufficient to induce excitability changes across distributed cortical sites. We found a subset of regions at which 10Hz prefrontal repetitive stimulation resulted in both potentiation and suppression of excitability that persisted for at least 10 minutes. We then asked if these dynamics could be modeled by the pre-stimulation connectivity profile of each subject. We found that cortical regions (i) anatomically close to the stimulated site and (ii) exhibiting high-amplitude CCEPs underwent changes in excitability following repetitive stimulation. We demonstrate high accuracy (72-95{\%}) and discriminability (81-99{\%}) in predicting regions exhibiting changes using individual subjects' pre-stimulation connectivity profile, and show that adding pre-stimulation connectivity features significantly improved model performance. The same features predicted regions of modulation following motor and temporal cortices stimulation in an independent dataset. Taken together, baseline connectivity profile can be used to predict regions susceptible to brain changes and provides a basis for personalizing therapeutic stimulation.

Significance Statement. Brain stimulation is increasingly used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders by inducing excitability changes at specific brain regions. However, our understanding of how, when, and where these changes are induced is critically lacking. We inferred plasticity in the human brain after applying electrical stimulation to the brain's surface and measuring changes in excitability. We observed excitability changes in regions anatomically and functionally closer to the stimulation site. Those in responsive regions were accurately predicted using a classifier trained on baseline brain network characteristics. Finally, we showed that the excitability changes can potentially be monitored in real-time. These results begin to fill basic gaps in our understanding of stimulation-induced neuronal dynamics in humans and offer pathways to optimize stimulation protocols.},

Objective To compare the effects of a 2-week multisite program of CIMT vs usual and customary care on improvement in upper extremity function among patients who had a first stroke within the previous 3 to 9 months. Design and Setting The Extremity Constraint Induced Therapy Evaluation (EXCITE) trial, a prospective, single-blind, randomized, multisite clinical trial con- ducted at 7 US academic institutions between January 2001 and January 2003. Participants Twohundred twenty-two individualswith predominantly ischemic stroke. Interventions Participants were assigned to receive either CIMT (n=106; wearing a restraining mitt on the less-affected hand while engaging in repetitive task practice and behavioral shaping with the hemiplegic hand) or usual and customary care (n=116; ranging from no treatment after concluding formal rehabilitation to pharmacologic or physiotherapeutic interventions); patients were stratified by sex, prestroke dominant side, side of stroke, and level of paretic arm function. Main OutcomeMeasures The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), a measure of laboratory time and strength-based ability and quality of movement (functional abil- ity), and the Motor Activity Log (MAL), a measure of how well and how often 30 com- mon daily activities are performed. Results From baseline to 12 months, the CIMT group showed greater improve- ments than the control group in both the WMFT Performance Time (decrease in mean time from 19.3 seconds to 9.3 seconds [52{\%} reduction] vs from 24.0 sec- onds to 17.7 seconds [26{\%} reduction]; between-group difference, 34{\%} [95{\%} con- fidence interval {\{}CI{\}}, 12{\%}-51{\%}]; P?.001) and in the MAL Amount of Use (on a 0-5 scale, increase from 1.21 to 2.13 vs from 1.15 to 1.65; between-group differ- ence, 0.43 [95{\%} CI, 0.05-0.80]; P?.001) and MAL Quality of Movement (on a 0-5 scale, increase from 1.26 to 2.23 vs 1.18 to 1.66; between-group difference, 0.48 [95{\%} CI, 0.13-0.84]; P?.001). The CIMT group achieved a decrease of 19.5 in self-perceived hand function difficulty (Stroke Impact Scale hand domain) vs a decrease of 10.1 for the control group (between-group difference, 9.42 [95{\%} CI, 0.27-18.57]; P=.05). Conclusion Among patients who had a stroke within the previous 3 to 9 months, CIMT produced statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in arm mo- tor function that persisted for at least 1 year.

@article{Avanzini2018,
abstract = {Here we show how anatomical and functional data recorded from patients undergoing stereo-EEG can be used to decompose the cortical processing following nerve stimulation in different stages characterized by specific topography and time course. Tibial, median and trigeminal nerves were stimulated in 96 patients, and the increase in gamma power was evaluated over 11878 cortical sites. All three nerve datasets exhibited similar clusters of time courses: phasic, delayed/prolonged and tonic, which differed in topography, temporal organization and degree of spatial overlap. Strong phasic responses of the three nerves followed the classical somatotopic organization of SI, with no overlap in either time or space. Delayed responses presented overlaps between pairs of body parts in both time and space, and were confined to the dorsal motor cortices. Finally, tonic responses occurred in the perisylvian region including posterior insular cortex and were evoked by the stimulation of all three nerves, lacking any spatial and temporal specificity. These data indicate that the somatosensory processing following nerve stimulation is a multi-stage hierarchical process common to all three nerves, with the different stages likely subserving different functions. While phasic responses represent the neural basis of tactile perception, multi-nerve tonic responses may represent the neural signature of processes sustaining the capacity to become aware of tactile stimuli.},

@article{Sommer2017,
abstract = {The vast majority of cerebral stroke cases are caused by transient or permanent occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel ("ischemic stroke") eventually leading to brain infarction. The final infarct size and the neurological outcome depend on a multitude of factors such as the duration and severity of ischemia, the existence of collateral systems and an adequate systemic blood pressure, etiology and localization of the infarct, but also on age, sex, comorbidities with the respective multimedication and genetic background. Thus, ischemic stroke is a highly complex and heterogeneous disorder. It is immediately obvious that experimental models of stroke can cover only individual specific aspects of this multifaceted disease. A basic understanding of the principal molecular pathways induced by ischemia-like conditions comes already from in vitro studies. One of the most frequently used in vivo models in stroke research is the endovascular suture or filament model in rodents with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), which causes reproducible infarcts in the MCA territory. It does not require craniectomy and allows reperfusion by withdrawal of the occluding filament. Although promptly restored blood flow is far from the pathophysiology of spontaneous human stroke, it more closely mimics the therapeutic situation of mechanical thrombectomy which is expected to be increasingly applied to stroke patients. Direct transient or permanent occlusion of cerebral arteries represents an alternative approach but requires craniectomy. Application of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, allows induction of transient focal ischemia in nearly any brain region and is frequently used to model lacunar stroke. Circumscribed and highly reproducible cortical lesions are characteristic of photothrombotic stroke where infarcts are induced by photoactivation of a systemically given dye through the intact skull. The major shortcoming of this model is near complete lack of a penumbra. The two models mimicking human stroke most closely are various embolic stroke models and spontaneous stroke models. Closeness to reality has its price and goes along with higher variability of infarct size and location as well as unpredictable stroke onset in spontaneous models versus unpredictable reperfusion in embolic clot models.},

abstract = {1. Oscillations of 20-40 Hz were observed in local field potentials (LFPs) and unit activity in sensorimotor cortices of three awake monkeys while the monkeys performed trained wrist movements and untrained exploratory arm movements. The mean frequency of LFP oscillations was 25.9 +/- 1.4 (SD) Hz and the number of cycles of oscillations per episode was variable, with a mean of 4.2 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SE). 2. Oscillatory episodes occurred most often when the monkeys retrieved raisins from a Kl{\"{u}}ver board (0.59 +/- 0.23 episodes per s, mean +/- SD) or from unseen locations with the use of somatosensory feedback (0.62 +/- 0.12 episodes per s); they occurred less often when the monkeys performed repetitive wrist flexion and extension movements (0.22 +/- 0.04 episodes per s) or sat quietly at rest (0.23 +/- 0.17 episodes per s). 3. The amplitude of LFP oscillations increased with depth in cortex, reaching a maximum between 1 and 2 mm. LFP oscillations at the surface of the cortex were 180 degrees out of phase with oscillations in the deep cortical layers. The phase shift (with respect to the deep layers) decreased with depth in the cortex and disappeared at depths of {\textgreater} 1 mm. 4. LFPs were recorded simultaneously at multiple sites in the sensorimotor cortex when monkeys retrieved raisins from a Kl{\"{u}}ver board or from unseen locations. Cross-correlation of LFPs recorded at different sites indicated that oscillations in the 20- to 40-Hz range could become synchronized at sites separated by up to {\textgreater} or = 14 mm in the precentral cortex. 5. The probability of occurrence of significant correlations between LFP oscillations at paired sites and the average correlation amplitude decreased with increasing horizontal separation of sites in precentral cortex. The phase shift between LFP oscillations recorded at paired sites did not change significantly with increasing horizontal separation. 6. For paired sites in precentral cortex, the average strength of correlations and the proportion of oscillations that were significantly correlated were greater during exploratory behaviors such as retrieving raisins from slots of the Kl{\"{u}}ver board than during periods of rest or overtrained wrist movements. 7. Oscillations could become synchronized with small phase shifts (0.5 +/- 1.6 ms) between pre- and postcentral cortical sites. Average strength and probability of occurrence of significant correlations between pre- and postcentral LFPs increased during exploratory behaviors. 8. Oscillations occurred simultaneously in the left and right motor cortex and could become synchronized with negligible phase shifts when the monkey performed bimanual manipulations. However, synchronization occurred as often and as strongly for unimanual as for bimanual manipulations. 9. These results indicate that episodes of 20- to 40-Hz oscillations occur often and become synchronized over a large cortical area during exploratory forelimb movements. However, they have no reliable relation to particular components of the movement and therefore seem unlikely to be involved directly in movement execution; instead, they may represent a neural correlate of attention during demanding sensorimotor behaviors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Residual motor deficits frequently linger after stroke. Search for newer effective strategies to promote functional recovery is ongoing. Brain stimulation, as a means of directing adaptive plasticity, is appealing. Animal studies and Phase I and II trials in humans have indicated safety, feasibility, and efficacy of combining rehabilitation and concurrent invasive cortical stimulation. However, a recent Phase III trial showed no advantage of the combination. We critically review results of various trials and discuss the factors that contributed to the distinctive result. SUMMARY OF REVIEW Regarding cortical stimulation, it is important to determine the (1) location of peri-infarct representations by integrating multiple neuroanatomical and physiological techniques; (2) role of other mechanisms of stroke recovery; (3) viability of peri-infarct tissue and descending pathways; (4) lesion geometry to ensure no alteration/displacement of current density; and (5) applicability of lessons generated from noninvasive brain stimulation studies in humans. In terms of combining stimulation with rehabilitation, we should understand (1) the principle of homeostatic plasticity; (2) the effect of ongoing cortical activity and phases of learning; and (3) that subject-specific intervention may be necessary. CONCLUSIONS Future cortical stimulation trials should consider the factors that may have contributed to the peculiar results of the Phase III trial and address those in future study designs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-frequency (e.g., gamma 30 to 50 Hz) coherent neural activity has been postulated to underlie binding of independent neural assemblies and thus integrate processing across distributed neuronal networks to achieve a unified conscious experience. Prior studies suggest that gamma activity may play a role in perceptual mechanisms, but design limitations raise concerns. Thus, controversy exists as to the hypothesis that gamma activity is necessary for perceptual awareness. In addition, controversy exists as to whether the primary sensory cortices are involved directly in the mechanisms of conscious perception or just in processes prior to conscious awareness. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation of gamma coherence and perception. METHODS: Digital intracranial electrocorticographic recordings from implanted electrodes were obtained in six patients with intractable epilepsy during a simple somatosensory detection task for near-threshold stimuli applied to the contralateral hand. Signal analyses were then conducted using a quantitative approach that employed two-way Hanning digital bandpass filters to compute running correlations across pairs of channels at various time epochs for each patient and each perception state across multiple bandwidths. RESULTS: Gamma coherence occurs in the primary somatosensory cortex approximately 150 to 300 milliseconds after contralateral hand stimuli that are perceived, but not for nonperceived stimuli, which did not differ in character/intensity or early somatosensory evoked potentials. CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with the possible direct involvement of primary sensory cortex in elemental awareness and with a role for gamma coherence in conscious perception.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In surgical planning for epileptic focus resection, functional mapping of eloquent cortex is attained through direct electrical stimulation of the brain. This procedure is uncomfortable, can trigger seizures or nausea, and relies on subjective evaluation. We hypothesize that a method combining vibrotactile stimulation and statistical clustering may provide improved somatosensory mapping.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Seven pediatric candidates for surgical resection underwent a task in which their fingers were independently stimulated using a custom designed finger pad, during electrocorticographic monitoring. A cluster-based statistical analysis was then performed to localize the elicited activity on the recording grids.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Mid-Gamma clusters (65-115 Hz) arose in areas consistent with anatomical predictions as well as clinical findings, with five subjects presenting a somatotopic organization of the fingers. This process allowed us to delineate finger representation even in patients who were sleeping, with strong interictal activity, or when electrical stimulation did not successfully locate eloquent areas.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We suggest that this scheme, relying on the endogenous neural response rather than exogenous electrical activation, could eventually be extended to map other sensory areas and provide a faster and more objective map to better anticipate outcomes of surgical resection.},

abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable users to control devices with electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from the scalp or with single-neuron activity from within the brain. Both methods have disadvantages: EEG has limited resolution and requires extensive training, while single-neuron recording entails significant clinical risks and has limited stability. We demonstrate here for the first time that electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity recorded from the surface of the brain can enable users to control a one-dimensional computer cursor rapidly and accurately. We first identified ECoG signals that were associated with different types of motor and speech imagery. Over brief training periods of 3-24 min, four patients then used these signals to master closed-loop control and to achieve success rates of 74-100{\%} in a one-dimensional binary task. In additional open-loop experiments, we found that ECoG signals at frequencies up to 180 Hz encoded substantial information about the direction of two-dimensional joystick movements. Our results suggest that an ECoG-based BCI could provide for people with severe motor disabilities a non-muscular communication and control option that is more powerful than EEG-based BCIs and is potentially more stable and less traumatic than BCIs that use electrodes penetrating the brain.},

Beyond the traditional correlation-based Hebbian plasticity, STDP opens up new avenues for understanding information coding and circuit plasticity that depend on the precise timing of neuronal spikes. Here we summarize experimental characterization of STDP at various synapses, the underlying cellular mechanisms, and the associated changes in neuronal excitability and dendritic integration. We also describe STDP in the context of complex spike patterns and its dependence on the dendritic location of the synapse. Finally, we discuss timing-dependent modification of neuronal receptive fields and human visual perception and the computational significance of STDP as a synaptic learning rule.},

abstract = {The law of prior entry was one of E.B. Titchener's seven fundamental laws of attention. According to Titchener (1908, p. 251): "the object of attention comes to consciousness more quickly than the objects which we are not attending to." Although researchers have been studying prior entry for more than a century now, progress in understanding the effect has been hindered by the many methodological confounds present in early research. As a consequence, it is unclear whether the behavioral effects reported in the majority of published studies in this area should be attributed to attention, decisional response biases, and/or, in the case of exogenous spatial cuing studies of the prior-entry effect, to sensory facilitation effects instead. In this article, the literature on the prior-entry effect is reviewed, the confounds present in previous research highlighted, current consensus summarized, and some of the key questions for future research outlined. In particular, recent research has now provided compelling psychophysical and electrophysiological evidence to support the claim that attending to a sensory modality, spatial location, or stimulus feature/attribute can all give rise to a relative speeding-up of the time of arrival of attended, as compared to relatively less attended (or unattended) stimuli. Prior-entry effects have now been demonstrated following both the endogenous and exogenous orienting of attention, though prior-entry effects tend to be smaller in magnitude when assessed by means of participants' performance on SJ tasks than when assessed by means of their performance on TOJ tasks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A series of animal experiments was conducted to characterize changes in the complex impedance of chronically implanted electrodes in neural tissue. Consistent trends in impedance changes were observed across all animals, characterized as a general increase in the measured impedance magnitude at 1 kHz. Impedance changes reach a peak approximately 7 days post-implant. Reactive responses around individual electrodes were described using immuno-and histo-chemistry and confocal microscopy. These observations were compared to measured impedance changes. Several features of impedance changes were able to differentiate between confined and extensive histological reactions. In general, impedance magnitude at 1 kHz was significantly increased in extensive reactions, starting about 4 days post-implant. Electrodes with extensive reactions also displayed impedance spectra with a characteristic change at high frequencies. This change was manifested in the formation of a semi-circular arc in the Nyquist space, suggestive of increased cellular density in close proximity to the electrode site. These results suggest that changes in impedance spectra are directly influenced by cellular distributions around implanted electrodes over time and that impedance measurements may provide an online assessment of cellular reactions to implanted devices.},

This is particularly evident when investigating short-latency neural activity in response to high-rate electrical stimulation. We developed and evaluated an off-line technique for the removal of stimulus artifact from electrophysiological recordings. Pulsatile electrical stimulation was presented at rates of up to 5000 pulses/s during extracellular recordings of guinea pig auditory nerve fibers. Stimulus artifact was removed by replacing the sample points at each stimulus artifact event with values interpolated along a straight line, computed from neighbouring sample points. This technique required only that artifact events be identifiable and that the artifact duration remained less than both the inter-stimulus interval and the time course of the action potential. We have demonstrated that this computationally efficient sample-and-interpolate technique removes the stimulus artifact with minimal distortion of the action potential waveform. We suggest that this technique may have potential applications in a range of electrophysiological recording systems.},

abstract = {Neural interface systems are becoming increasingly more feasible for brain repair strategies. This paper tests the hypothesis that recovery after brain injury can be facilitated by a neural prosthesis serving as a communication link between distant locations in the cerebral cortex. The primary motor area in the cerebral cortex was injured in a rat model of focal brain injury, disrupting communication between motor and somatosensory areas and resulting in impaired reaching and grasping abilities. After implantation of microelectrodes in cerebral cortex, a neural prosthesis discriminated action potentials (spikes) in premotor cortex that triggered electrical stimulation in somatosensory cortex continuously over subsequent weeks. Within 1 wk, while receiving spike-triggered stimulation, rats showed substantially improved reaching and grasping functions that were indistinguishable from prelesion levels by 2 wk. Post hoc analysis of the spikes evoked by the stimulation provides compelling evidence that the neural prosthesis enhanced functional connectivity between the two target areas. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that neural interface systems can be used effectively to bridge damaged neural pathways functionally and promote recovery after brain injury.},

With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using un-supervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},

abstract = {During active movement the electric potentials measured from the surface of the motor cortex exhibit consistent modulation, revealing two distinguishable processes in the power spectrum. At frequencies {\textless}40 Hz, narrow-band power decreases occur with movement over widely distributed cortical areas, while at higher frequencies there are spatially more focal power increases. These high-frequency changes have commonly been assumed to reflect synchronous rhythms, analogous to lower-frequency phenomena, but it has recently been proposed that they reflect a broad-band spectral change across the entire spectrum, which could be obscured by synchronous rhythms at low frequencies. In 10 human subjects performing a finger movement task, we demonstrate that a principal component type of decomposition can naively separate low-frequency narrow-band rhythms from an asynchronous, broad-spectral, change at all frequencies between 5 and 200 Hz. This broad-spectral change exhibited spatially discrete representation for individual fingers and reproduced the temporal movement trajectories of different individual fingers.},

abstract = {The present review focusses on how tactile somatosensory afference is encoded and processed, and how this information is interpreted and acted upon in terms of motor control. We relate the fundamental workings of the sensorimotor system to the rehabilitation of amputees using modern prosthetic interventions. Our sense of touch is central to our everyday lives, from allowing us to manipulate objects accurately to giving us a sense of self-embodiment. There are a variety of specialised cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents, which differ in terms of type and density according to the skin site. In humans, there is a dense innervation of our hands, which is reflected in their vast over-representation in somatosensory and motor cortical areas. We review the accumulated evidence from animal and human studies about the precise interplay between the somatosensory and motor systems, which is highly integrated in many brain areas and often not separable. The glabrous hand skin provides exquisite, discriminative detail about touch, which is useful for refining movements. When these signals are disrupted, such as through injury or amputation, the consequences are considerable. The development of sensory feedback in prosthetics offers a promising avenue for the full integration of a missing body part. Real-time touch feedback from motor intentions aids in grip control and the ability to distinguish different surfaces, even introducing the possibility of pleasure in artificial touch. Thus, our knowledge from fundamental research into sensorimotor interactions should be used to develop more realistic and integrative prostheses.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that neural oscillations in the 8- to 12-Hz range influence sensory perception. In the current study, we examined whether both the power and phase of these mu/alpha oscillations predict successful conscious tactile perception. Near-threshold tactile stimuli were applied to the left hand while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded over the contralateral right somatosensory cortex. We found a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between prestimulus mu/alpha power and detection rate, suggesting that there is an intermediate level of alpha power that is optimal for tactile perception. We also found a significant difference in phase angle concentration at stimulus onset that predicted whether the upcoming tactile stimulus was perceived or missed. As has been shown in the visual system, these findings suggest that these mu/alpha oscillations measured over somatosensory areas exert a strong inhibitory control on tactile perception and that pulsed inhibition by these oscillations shapes the state of brain activity necessary for conscious perception. They further suggest that these common phasic processing mechanisms across different sensory modalities and brain regions may reflect a common underlying encoding principle in perceptual processing that leads to momentary windows of perceptual awareness.},

abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a practical method for the direct quantification of frequency-specific synchronization (i.e., transient phase-locking) between two neuroelectric signals. The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics (PLS), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution ({\textless}100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, PLS separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, PLS uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply PLS to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony.},

Lachaux et al. describe a method to quantify phase locking (synchronization which is frequency specific), between two neural electrical brain signals. This metric measures phase covariance between two signals with a time resolution of less than 100 ms. Phase and amplitude are separated, and the statistics make no prior assumptions about the experimental data, which allows for validation of synchrony values against background fluctuations. The authors argue that long distance effects are indicative of cognitive processing, compared to shorter distance effects which they say are a consequence of volume conduction.},

abstract = {Spectral signal analysis constitutes one of the most important and most commonly used analytical tools for the evaluation of neurophysiological signals. It is not only the spectral parameters per se (amplitude and phase) which are of interest, but there is also a variety of measures derived from them, including important coupling measures like coherence or phase synchrony. After reviewing some of these measures in order to underline the widespread relevance of spectral analysis, this report compares the three classical spectral analysis approaches: Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet transform. Recently, there seems to be increasing acceptance of the notion that Hilbert- or wavelet-based analyses be in some way superior to Fourier-based analyses. The present article counters such views by demonstrating that the three techniques are in fact formally (i.e. mathematically) equivalent when using the class of wavelets that is typically applied in spectral analyses. Moreover, spectral amplitude serves as an example to show that Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet analysis also yield equivalent results in practical applications to neuronal signals.},

The field of neurorehabilitation has begun to use this body of work to develop neurobiologicallyinformed therapies that harness the key behavioral and neural signals that drive neural plasticity. The present review describes how neural plasticity supports both learning in the intact CNS and functional improvement in the damaged or diseased CNS. A pragmatic, interdisciplinary definition of neural plasticity is presented that may be used by both clinical and basic scientists studying neurorehabilitation. Furthermore, a description of howneural plasticity may act to drive different neural strategies underlying functional improvement after CNS injury or disease is provided.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine the effect of stimulus train duration (TD) on sensory perception using direct stimulation of somatosensory and visual cortices. 2) To investigate the occurrence of evoked potentials in response to stimulation that is subthreshold for perception. BACKGROUND: Studies of the mechanisms of conscious perception using direct cortical stimulation and recording techniques are rare. The clinical necessity to implant subdural electrode grids in epilepsy patients undergoing evaluation for surgery offers an opportunity to examine the role of stimulus parameters and evoked potentials in conscious perception. METHODS: Subjects included epilepsy patients with grids over somatosensory or occipital cortex. Single pulses (100 microseconds) and stimulus trains were applied to electrodes, and thresholds for perception were found. Evoked potentials were recorded in response to peripheral stimulation at intensities at, above, and below sensory threshold. RESULTS: During cortical stimulation, sensory threshold changed little for stimulus trains of 250 milliseconds and longer, but increased sharply as TD decreased below this level. Primary evoked activity was recorded in response to peripheral stimulations that were subthreshold for conscious perception. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm a previous report of the effects of stimulus TD on sensory threshold. However, no motor responses occurred following somatosensory stimulation with short trains, as previously reported. The TD threshold pattern was similar in visual cortex. In agreement with the previous report, early components of the primary evoked response were not correlated with conscious sensory awareness.},

We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the “Chinese restaurant franchise.” We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling.},

SEPs induced by electrical stimulation and especially after median nerve stimulation is a method widely used in the literature. It is unclear, however, if the EEG recordings after finger stimulation are reproducible within the same subject. We tested in five healthy subjects the consistency and reproducibility of responses through bootstrapping as well as test–retest recordings. We further evaluated the possibility to discriminate activity of different fingers both at electrode and at source level. The lack of consistency and reproducibility suggest responses to finger stimulation to be unreliable, even with reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio and adequate number of trials. At sources level, somatotopic arrangement of the fingers representation was only found in one of the subjects. Although finding distinct locations of the different fingers activation was possible, our protocol did not allow for non-overlapping dipole representations of the fingers. We conclude that despite its theoretical advantages, we cannot recommend the use of somatosensory potentials evoked by finger stimulation to extract clinical biomarkers.},

However, the neuroanatomical substrates underlying the connection between aberrant sensory input and ineffective motor output are still under investigation. The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) plays a critical role in processing afferent somatosensory input and contributes to the integration of sensory and motor signals necessary for skilled movement. Neuroimaging and neurostimulation approaches provide unique opportunities to non-invasively study S1 structure and function including connectivity with other cortical regions. These research techniques have begun to illuminate casual contributions of abnormal S1 activity and connectivity to motor dysfunction and poorer recovery of motor function in neurologic patient populations. This review synthesizes recent evidence illustrating the role of S1 in motor control, motor learning and functional recovery with an emphasis on how information from these investigations may be exploited to inform stroke rehabilitation to reduce motor dysfunction and improve therapeutic outcomes.},

Regaining partial function can lead to greater independence, thereby improving quality of life. To ascertain what functions are most important to the SCI population, in regard to enhancing quality of life, a novel survey was performed in which subjects were asked to rank seven functions in order of importance to their quality of life. The survey was distributed via email, postal mail, the internet, interview, and word of mouth to the SCI community at large. A total of 681 responses were completed. Regaining arm and hand function was most important to quadriplegics, while regaining sexual function was the highest priority for paraplegics. Improving bladder and bowel function was of shared importance to both injury groups. A longitudinal analysis revealed only slight differences between individuals injured {\textless}3 years compared to those injured {\textgreater}3 years. The majority of participants indicated that exercise was important to functional recovery, yet more than half either did not have access to exercise or did not have access to a trained therapist to oversee that exercise. In order to improve the relevance of research in this area, the concerns of the SCI population must be better known and taken into account. This approach is consistent with and emphasized by the new NIH roadmap to discovery.},

Results: Both ICA and the ODR can minimize the artifact and allow measurement of CAEP responses. Conclusions: When using a large number of recording electrodes ICA can be used to minimize the implant artifact. When using a single electrode montage an optimized differential reference is adequate to minimize the artifact.

abstract = {The motor cortex and spinal cord possess the remarkable ability to alter structure and function in response to differential motor training. Here we review the evidence that the corticospinal system is not only plastic but that the nature and locus of this plasticity is dictated by the specifics of the motor experience. Skill training induces synaptogenesis, synaptic potentiation, and reorganization of movement representations within motor cortex. Endurance training induces angiogenesis in motor cortex, but it does not alter motor map organization or synapse number. Strength training alters spinal motoneuron excitability and induces synaptogenesis within spinal cord, but it does not alter motor map organization. All three training experiences induce changes in spinal reflexes that are dependent on the specific behavioral demands of the task. These results demonstrate that the acquisition of skilled movement induces a reorganization of neural circuitry within motor cortex that supports the production and refinement of skilled movement sequences. We present data that suggest increases in strength may be mediated by an increased capacity for activation and/or recruitment of spinal motoneurons while the increased metabolic demands associated with endurance training induce cortical angiogenesis. Together these results show the robust pattern of anatomic and physiological plasticity that occurs within the corticospinal system in response to differential motor experience. The consequences of such distributed, experience-specific plasticity for the encoding of motor experience by the motor system are discussed.},

abstract = {Monkeys can detect electrical stimulation delivered to the striate cortex (area V1). We examined whether such stimulation is layer dependent. While remaining fixated on a spot of light, a rhesus monkey was required to detect a 100-ms train of electrical stimulation delivered to a site within area V1. A monkey signaled the delivery of stimulation by depressing a lever after which he was rewarded with a drop of apple juice. Control trials were interleaved during which time no stimulation was delivered and the monkey was rewarded for not depressing the lever. Biphasic pulses were delivered at 200 Hz, and the current was typically at or {\textless} 30 muA using 0.2-ms cathode-first biphasic pulses. For some experiments, the pulse duration was varied from 0.05 to 0.7 ms and anode-first pulses were used. The current threshold for detecting cathode-first pulses 50{\%} of the time was the lowest ({\textless} 10 muA) when stimulation was delivered to the deepest layers of V1 (between 1.0 and 2.5 mm below the cortical surface). Also, the shortest chronaxies ({\textless} 0.2 ms) and the shortest latencies ({\textless} 200 ms) for detecting the stimulation were observed at these depths. Finally, anode-first pulses were most effective at evoking a detection response in superficial V1 and cathode-first pulses were most effective at evoking a detection response in deep V1 ({\textgreater} 1.75 mm below the cortical surface). Accordingly, the deepest layers of V1 are the most sensitive for the induction of a detection response to electrical stimulation in monkeys.},

abstract = {Little is known about the neuronal mechanisms underlying the temporal ordering of tactile signals. We examined the brain regions involved in judgments of the temporal order of successive taps delivered to both hands. Participants received identical stimuli while engaging in 2 different tasks: Judging the temporal order and judging the numerosity of points of tactile stimulation. Comparisons of the functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained during the 2 tasks revealed regions that were more strongly activated with the judgments of the temporal order than with the judgments of numerosity under both arms-uncrossed and -crossed conditions: The bilateral premotor cortices, the bilateral middle frontal gyri, the bilateral inferior parietal cortices and supramarginal gyri, and the bilateral posterior part of the superior and middle temporal gyri. Stronger activation was found in some of these areas that implicated for remapping tactile stimuli to spatial coordinates after the participants crossed their arms. The activation in the perisylvian areas overlapped with the human visual-motion-sensitive areas in the posterior part. Based on these results, we propose that the temporal order of tactile signals is determined by combining spatial representations of stimuli in the parietal and prefrontal cortices with representations of "motion" or "changes" in the multisensory perisylvian cortex.},

abstract = {The localization of cortical sites essential for language was assessed by stimulation mapping in the left, dominant hemispheres of 117 patients. Sites were related to language when stimulation at a current below the threshold for afterdischarge evoked repeated statistically significant errors in object naming. The language center was highly localized in many patients to form several mosaics of 1 to 2 sq cm, usually one in the frontal and one or more in the temporoparietal lobe. The area of individual mosaics, and the total area related to language was usually much smaller than the traditional Broca-Wernicke areas. There was substantial individual variability in the exact location of language function, some of which correlated with the patient's sex and verbal intelligence. These features were present for patients as young as 4 years and as old as 80 years, and for those with lesions acquired in early life or adulthood. These findings indicate a need for revision of the classical model of language localization. The combination of discrete localization in individual patients but substantial individual variability between patients also has major clinical implications for cortical resections of the dominant hemisphere, for it means that language cannot be reliably localized on anatomic criteria alone. A maximal resection with minimal risk of postoperative aphasia requires individual localization of language with a technique like stimulation mapping.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recently, electrocorticography-based brain-computer interfaces have been successfully used to translate cortical activity into control signals for external devices. However, the utility of such devices would be greatly enhanced by somatosensory feedback. Direct stimulation of somatosensory cortex evokes sensory perceptions, and is thus a promising option for closing the loop. Before this can be implemented in humans it is necessary to evaluate how changes in stimulus parameters are perceived and the extent to which they can be discriminated. APPROACH: Electrical stimulation was delivered to the somatosensory cortex of human subjects implanted with electrocorticography grids. Subjects were asked to discriminate between stimuli of different frequency and amplitude as well as to report the qualitative sensations elicited by the stimulation. MAIN RESULTS: In this study we show that in humans implanted with electrocorticography grids, variations in the amplitude or frequency of cortical electrical stimulation produce graded variations in percepts. Subjects were able to reliably distinguish between different stimuli. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that direct cortical stimulation is a feasible option for sensory feedback with brain-computer interface devices.},

abstract = {Background Although computational studies of electrical brain stimulation (EBS) have received attention as a cost-effective tool, few studies have validated the technique, particularly in invasive cortical stimulation. Objective In order to validate such studies, we used EBS to compare electric potential distributions generated by both numerical simulations and empirical measurements in three phantom head models (one-/three-layered spherical heads and MRI-based head). Methods We constructed spherical phantom heads that consisted of one or three layers, and an anatomical, MRI-based phantom that consisted of three layers and represented the brain or brain/skull/scalp in order to perform both numerical simulations using the finite element method (FEM) and experimental measurements. Two stimulation electrodes (cathode and anode) were implanted in the phantoms to inject regulated input voltage, and the electric potential distributions induced were measured at various points located either on the surface or deep within the phantoms. Results We observed that both the electric potential distributions from the numerical simulations and experiments behaved similarly and resulted in average relative differences of 5.4{\%} (spherical phantom) and 10.3{\%} (MRI-based phantom). Conclusions This study demonstrated that numerical simulation is reasonably consistent with actual experimental measurements; thus, because of its cost-effectiveness, EBS computational studies may be an attractive approach for necessary intensive/extensive studies.},

We looked for such proof in monkeys trained to discriminate between two mechanical flutter stimuli applied sequentially to the fingertips. Microelectrodes were inserted into clusters of quickly adapting (QA) neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and the first or both stimuli were then substituted with trains of current pulses during the discrimination task. Psychophysical performance with artificial stimulus frequencies was almost identical to that measured with the natural stimulus frequencies. Our results indicate that microstimulation can be used to elicit a memorizable and discriminable analog range of percepts, and shows that activation of the QA circuit of S1 is sufficient to initiate all subsequent neural processes associated with flutter discrimination.},

abstract = {The authors note, " For the 'hybrid' location discrimination task, we report data obtained from 27 electrodes, 16 of which were in area 1; the 11 electrodes in area 3b were divided evenly across the two animals (6 and 5). We had previously tested all of the electrodes, including those in area 3b, in the detection and discrimination tasks (as shown in Fig. 3) and found them all to yield approximately equivalent performance (see Fig 3A). We noticed in the hybrid location discrimination task, however, that one of the animals performed much more poorly based on stimulation of area 3b than it did based on stimulation of area 1 (while the other animal performed better based on stimulation of area 1). Having no reason to question any of the arrays, we attributed this discrepancy to differences across animals and arrived at the conclusion, based on pooled data from both animals, that stimulation of the two areas yields equivalent performance in the 'hybrid location discrimination' task. The overall conclusion, then, was that stimulation of neurons in area 3b and 1 evokes percepts that are equally localized on the skin. " Shortly after publication of the paper, we repeated detection experiments across the arrays and found that the animal could no longer detect stimulation through the array in area 3b that had yielded poor performance in the hybrid location discrimina-tion task. It is therefore likely that this array had failed between the time we conducted the initial detection and discrimination experiments and the time we conducted the hybrid location discrimination task (which required 2–3 months of retraining). If this is the case, and we eliminate data from that bad array, then the median performance on hybrid trials is 83{\%} (up from the 80{\%} that was originally reported), which is still statistically poorer than that on the location-matched mechanical trials [median difference between performance on mechanical and hybrid trials was 3.3{\%} rather than 5.6{\%}, t (119) = 6.1, P {\textless} 0.001] (see the corrected Fig. 2). Thus, we probably underestimated overall performance on hybrid trials, and thus the degree to which artificial percepts are localized, in the original publication. Im-portantly, however, performance on hybrid trials based on stim-ulation of area 3b was significantly better than performance based on stimulation of area 1 [median $\Delta$p = 0.028 and 0.054 for areas 3b and 1, respectively; t test: t (76) = 2.8, P {\textless} 0.01]. Thus, based on the data obtained from only one animal, it seems as though stimulation of area 3b elicits more localized percepts than does stimulation of area 1, as might be expected given that neurons in area 3b tend to have smaller receptive fields than their counterparts in area 1 (1, 2). " As a result of this error, Fig. 2 and its legend appeared in-correctly. The corrected figure and its corresponding legend appear below. 1.

(A) On both mechanical and hybrid trials, the relative locations of stimuli applied to widely spaced digits were more accurately discriminated than were the relative locations of stimuli applied to adjacent digits. Mea-sured from one animal, mechanical performance was based on 1,160 and 1,031 trials, respectively (green and gold); hybrid performance on 246 and 196 trials, respectively. To compare performance on hybrid trials and per-formance on mechanical trials matched for hand location, we computed the difference between the two: $\Delta$p = p mech (correct) − p hybrid (correct). (B) Per-formance on mechanical and hybrid trials was nearly equivalent. Shown is the distribution of $\Delta$p for the two animals tested on this task (88 stimulus pairs, 21 different electrodes, 16 of which are UEAs). Across electrodes, performance was significantly above chance, demonstrating that ICMS yields spatially localized percepts. Performance on hybrid trials was somewhat lower than on mechanical location discrimination trials (median $\Delta$p = 0.033), suggesting that the elicited percepts may be somewhat more diffuse than natural ones. There was no significant difference in performance based on stimulation of areas 3b or 1, so data from these two areas are pooled.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) has been utilized to evaluate connectivity between cortices. However, previous reports have rarely referred to the impact of volume-conducted potential (VCP) which must be a confounding factor of large potential around the stimulation site. To address this issue, we challenged the null hypothesis that VCP accounts for the majority of the recorded potential, particularly around the stimulation site. METHODS CCEP was recorded with high-density intracranial electrodes in 8 patients with intractable epilepsy. First, we performed regression analysis for describing the relationship between the distance and potential of each electrode. Second, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to reveal the temporal features of recorded waveforms. RESULTS The regression curve, declining by the inverse square of the distance, fitted tightly to the plots (R(2): 0.878-0.991) with outliers. PCA suggested the responses around the stimulation site had the same temporal features. We also observed the continuous declination over the anatomical gap and the phase reversal phenomena around the stimulation site. CONCLUSIONS These results were consistent with the null hypothesis. SIGNIFICANCE This study highlighted the risk of misinterpreting CCEP mapping, and proposed mathematical removal of VCP, which could lead to more reliable mapping based on CCEP.},

abstract = {The link between object perception and neural activity in visual cortical areas is a problem of fundamental importance in neuroscience. Here we show that electrical potentials from the ventral temporal cortical surface in humans contain sufficient information for spontaneous and near-instantaneous identification of a subject's perceptual state. Electrocorticographic (ECoG) arrays were placed on the subtemporal cortical surface of seven epilepsy patients. Grayscale images of faces and houses were displayed rapidly in random sequence. We developed a template projection approach to decode the continuous ECoG data stream spontaneously, predicting the occurrence, timing and type of visual stimulus. In this setting, we evaluated the independent and joint use of two well-studied features of brain signals, broadband changes in the frequency power spectrum of the potential and deflections in the raw potential trace (event-related potential; ERP). Our ability to predict both the timing of stimulus onset and the type of image was best when we used a combination of both the broadband response and ERP, suggesting that they capture different and complementary aspects of the subject's perceptual state. Specifically, we were able to predict the timing and type of 96{\%} of all stimuli, with less than 5{\%} false positive rate and a {\~{}}20ms error in timing.},

abstract = {Essential tremor is the most common neurological movement disorder. This progressive disease causes uncontrollable rhythmic motions—most often affecting the patient's dominant upper extremity—that occur during volitional movement and make it difficult for the patient to perform everyday tasks. Medication may also become ineffective as the disorder progresses. For many patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus is an effective means of treating this condition when medication fails. In current use, however, clinicians set the patient's stimulator to apply stimulation at all times—whether it is needed or not. This practice leads to excess power use, and more rapid depletion of batteries that require surgical replacement. In the work described here, for the first time, neural sensing of movement (using chronically-implanted cortical electrodes) is used to enable or disable stimulation for tremor. Therapeutic stimulation is delivered only when the patient is actively using their effected limb, thereby reducing the total stimulation applied, and potentially extending the lifetime of surgically-implanted batteries. This work, which involves both implanted and external subsystems, paves the way for the future fully-implanted closed-loop deep brain stimulators.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Closed-loop electrical brain stimulation systems may enable a precisely-tailored treatment for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders by controlling the stimulation based on neural activity feedback in real time. Developing model-based closed-loop systems requires a principled system identification framework to quantify the effect of input stimulation on output neural activity by learning an input-output (IO) dynamic model from data. Further, developing these systems needs a realistic clinical simulation testbed to design and validate the closed-loop controllers derived from the IO models before testing in human patients. APPROACH First, we design a control-theoretic system identification framework to build dynamic IO models for neural activity that are amenable to closed-loop control design. To enable tractable model-based control, we use a data-driven linear state-space IO model that characterizes the effect of input on neural activity in terms of a low-dimensional hidden neural state. To learn the model parameters, we design a novel input waveform-a pulse train modulated by stochastic binary noise (BN) parameters-that we show is optimal for collecting informative IO datasets in system identification and conforms to clinical safety requirements. Second, we further extend this waveform to a generalized BN (GBN)-modulated waveform to reduce the required system identification time. Third, to enable extensive testing of system identification and closed-loop control, we develop a real-time closed-loop clinical hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation testbed using the [Formula: see text] microelectrode recording and stimulation device, which incorporates stochastic noises, unknown disturbances and stimulation artifacts. Using this testbed, we implement both the system identification and the closed-loop controller by taking control of mood in depression as an example. RESULTS Testbed simulation results show that the closed-loop controller designed from IO models identified with the BN-modulated waveform achieves tight control, and performs similar to a controller that knows the true IO model of neural activity. When system identification time is limited, performance is further improved using the GBN-modulated waveform. SIGNIFICANCE The system identification framework with the new BN-modulated waveform and the clinical HIL simulation testbed can help develop future model-based closed-loop electrical brain stimulation systems for treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {The typical control of myoelectric interfaces, whether in laboratory settings or real-life prosthetic applications, largely relies on visual feedback because proprioceptive signals from the controlling muscles are either not available or very noisy. We conducted a set of experiments to test whether artificial proprioceptive feedback, delivered non-invasively to another limb, can improve control of a two-dimensional myoelectrically-controlled computer interface. In these experiments, participants' were required to reach a target with a visual cursor that was controlled by electromyogram signals recorded from muscles of the left hand, while they were provided with an additional proprioceptive feedback on their right arm by moving it with a robotic manipulandum. Provision of additional artificial proprioceptive feedback improved the angular accuracy of their movements when compared to using visual feedback alone but did not increase the overall accuracy quantified with the average distance between the cursor and the target. The advantages conferred by proprioception were present only when the proprioceptive feedback had similar orientation to the visual feedback in the task space and not when it was mirrored, demonstrating the importance of congruency in feedback modalities for multi-sensory integration. Our results reveal the ability of the human motor system to learn new inter-limb sensory-motor associations; the motor system can utilize task-related sensory feedback, even when it is available on a limb distinct from the one being actuated. In addition, the proposed task structure provides a flexible test paradigm by which the effectiveness of various sensory feedback and multi-sensory integration for myoelectric prosthesis control can be evaluated.},

One approach to restoring lost sensory and motor abilities in amputees and patients with tetraplegia is to supply them with implants that provide a direct interface with the CNS. Such brain-machine interfaces might enable a patient to exert voluntary control over a prosthetic or robotic limb or over the electrically induced contractions of paralysed muscles. A parallel interface could convey sensory information about the consequences of these movements back to the patient. Recent developments in the algorithms that decode motor intention from neuronal activity and in approaches to convey sensory feedback by electrically stimulating neurons, using biomimetic and adaptation-based approaches, have shown the promise of invasive interfaces with sensorimotor cortices, although substantial challenges remain.},

However, skilled manipulation of objects requires somatosensory feedback, for which vision is a poor substitute. For upper-limb neuroprostheses to be clinically viable, they must therefore provide for the restoration of touch and proprioception. In this review, I discuss efforts to elicit meaningful tactile sensations through stimulation of neurons in somatosensory cortex. I focus on biomimetic approaches to sensory restoration, which leverage our current understanding about how information about grasped objects is encoded in the brain of intact individuals. I argue that not only can sensory neuroscience inform the development of sensory neuroprostheses, but also that the converse is true: stimulating the brain offers an exceptional opportunity to causally interrogate neural circuits and test hypotheses about natural neural coding.},

abstract = {We describe an algorithm for suppression of stimulation artifacts in extracellular micro-electrode array (MEA) recordings. A model of the artifact based on locally fitted cubic polynomials is subtracted from the recording, yielding a flat baseline amenable to spike detection by voltage thresholding. The algorithm, SALPA, reduces the period after stimulation during which action potentials cannot be detected by an order of magnitude, to less than 2 ms. Our implementation is fast enough to process 60-channel data sampled at 25 kHz in real-time on an inexpensive desktop PC. It performs well on a wide range of artifact shapes without re-tuning any parameters, because it accounts for amplifier saturation explicitly and uses a statistic to verify successful artifact suppression immediately after the amplifiers become operational. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on recordings from dense monolayer cultures of cortical neurons obtained from rat embryos. SALPA opens up a previously inaccessible window for studying transient neural oscillations and precisely timed dynamics in short-latency responses to electric stimulation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although we understand several aspects of electrical stimulation at the cellular level, surface DES evokes a complex summation effect in a large volume of brain tissue, and the effect is difficult to predict as it depends on many local and remote physiological and morphological factors. The complex stimulation effects are reflected in the heterogeneity of behavioural effects that are induced by DES, which range from evocation to inhibition of responses - sometimes even when DES is applied at the same cortical site. Thus, it is a misconception that DES - in contrast to other neuroscience techniques - allows us to draw unequivocal conclusions about the role of stimulated brain areas.},

An increasingly promising approach to sensory restoration is to electrically stimulate neurons along the somatosensory neuraxis to convey information about the state of the prosthetic limb and about contact with objects. To date, efforts toward artificial sensory feedback have consisted mainly of demonstrating that some sensory information could be conveyed using a small number of stimulation patterns, generally delivered through single electrodes. However impressive these achievements are, results from different studies are hard to compare, as each research team implements different stimulation patterns and tests the elicited sensations differently. A critical question is whether different stimulation strategies will generalize from contrived laboratory settings to activities of daily living. Here, we lay out some key specifications that an artificial somatosensory channel should meet, discuss how different approaches should be evaluated, and caution about looming challenges that the field of sensory restoration will face.},

After an initial screening and feature selection on the 1st day, 5 consecutive days of cursor-based feedback were performed with a fixed parameterization. Control of the interface was robust throughout all days, with performance increasing to a stable state in which high-frequency ECoG signal could immediately be translated into cursor control.

abstract = {Brain-state-dependent stimulation combines brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and cortical stimulation into one paradigm that allows the online decoding for example of movement intention from brain signals while simultaneously applying stimulation. If the BCI decoding is performed by spectral features, stimulation after-effects such as artefacts and evoked activity present a challenge for a successful implementation of brain-state-dependent stimulation because they can impair the detection of targeted brain states. Therefore, efficient and robust methods are needed to minimize the influence of the stimulation-induced effects on spectral estimation without violating the real-time constraints of the BCI. In this work, we compared 4 methods for spectral estimation with autoregressive (AR) models in the presence of pulsed cortical stimulation. Using combined EEG-TMS as well as combined ECoG and epidural electrical stimulation, 3 patients performed a motor task using a sensorimotor-rhythm BCI. Three stimulation paradigms were varied between sessions: (1) no stimulation, (2) single stimulation pulses applied independently (open-loop) or (3) coupled to the BCI output (closed-loop) such that stimulation was given only while an intention to move was detected using neural data. We found that removing the stimulation after-effects by linear interpolation can introduce a bias in the estimation of the spectral power of the sensorimotor rhythm, leading to an overestimation of decoding performance in the closed-loop setting. We propose the use of the Burg algorithm for segmented data to deal with stimulation after-effects. This work shows that the combination of BCIs controlled with spectral features and cortical stimulation in a closed-loop fashion is possible when the influence of stimulation after-effects on spectral estimation is minimized.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical treatment, which has proven useful in treating Parkinson's disease. This systematic review assessed the safety and effectiveness of DBS for another movement disorder, essential tremor. All studies concerning the use of DBS in patients with essential tremor were identified through searching of electronic databases and hand searching of reference lists. Studies were categorized as before/after DBS or DBS stimulation on/off to allow the effect of the stimulation to be analyzed separately to that of the surgery itself. A total of 430 patients who had received DBS for essential tremor were identified. Most of the reported adverse events were mild and could be treated through changing the stimulation settings. Generally, in all studies, there was a significant improvement in outcomes after DBS compared with baseline scores. In addition, DBS was significantly better in testing when the stimulation was turned on, compared with stimulation turned off or baseline. Based on Level IV evidence, DBS is possibly a safe and effective therapy for essential tremor.},

abstract = {Objective: Single Pulse Electrical Stimulation (SPES) probes epileptogenic cortex during electrocorticography. Two SPES responses are described: pathological delayed responses (DR, {\textgreater}100 ms) associated with the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and physiological early responses (ER, {\textless}100 ms) that map cortical connectivity. We analyzed properties of ERs, including frequencies {\textgreater}80 Hz, in the SOZ and seizure propagation areas. Methods: We used data from 12 refractory epilepsy patients. SPES consisted of 10 pulses of 1 ms, 4-mA and 5 s interval on adjacent electrodes pairs. Data were available at 2048 samples/s for six and 512 samples/s (22 bits) for eight patients and analyzed in the time-frequency (TF) and time-domain (TD). Results: Electrodes with ERs were stronger associated with SOZ than non-SOZ electrodes. ERs with frequency content {\textgreater}80 Hz exist and are specific for SOZ channels. ERs evoked by stimulation of seizure onset electrodes were associated with electrodes involved in seizure propagation. Conclusion: Analysis of ERs can reveal aspects of pathology, manifested by association with seizure propagation and areas with high ER numbers that coincide with the SOZ. Significance: Not only DRs, but also ERs could have clinical value for mapping epileptogenic cortex and help to unravel aspects of the epileptic network.},

abstract = {1. The neural activity associated with 20- to 40-Hz oscillations in sensorimotor cortex of awake monkeys was investigated by recording action potentials of single and multiple units. At a given site, activity of many units became synchronized with local field potential (LFP) oscillations. Cycle-triggered histograms (CTHs) of unit spikes aligned on cycles of LFP oscillations indicated that about two thirds of the recorded units (n = 268) were entrained with LFP oscillations. On average, units had the highest probability of spiking 2.7 ms before peak LFP negativity, corresponding to a -27.6 degrees phase shift relative to the negative peak of the LFP. 2. The average relative modulation amplitude (RMA), defined as the ratio of amplitude of oscillatory component of CTH and the baseline multiplied by 100, was 45 +/- 27{\%} (mean +/- SD). The RMAs of single units did not differ significantly from those of multiple units. 3. Phase shifts and RMAs did not vary systematically with the cortical depth of recorded units. 4. Autocorrelation histograms (ACHs) of entrained units exhibited clear 20- to 40-Hz periodicity if they were compiled with spikes that occurred during oscillatory episodes in LFPs. ACHs of spikes outside oscillatory episodes usually did not show periodicity. Global ACHs of all spikes typically showed weak or no evidence of periodic activity. 5. Cross-correlation histograms (CCHs) between pairs of units complied with all spikes, whether they occurred during or outside LFP oscillations, seldom revealed significant features (19 of 134 pairs or 14{\%}). However, CCHs compiled with spikes that occurred during oscillatory episodes (OS-CCHs) had significant features in 67 of 134 pairs recorded ipsilaterally; in these 67 cases, units at both sites showed modulation in CTHs. 6. The latencies of the OS-CCH peaks (taking the medial unit as reference) were normally distributed about a mean of -0.5 +/- 13 ms. Normalized peak height of CCHs (peak/baseline x 100) was, on average, 14.3 +/- 11.2{\%}. Peak latency and normalized peak amplitude did not change significantly with horizontal separation of recorded precentral pairs up to 14 mm. 7. Units in the left and right hemispheres could become synchronized during oscillations. Significant features in OS-CCH were detected in 22 of 42 pairs of units recorded bilaterally. The average peak latency was 0.2 +/- 8.0 ms and the average normalized peak amplitude was 10 +/- 8{\%}. These parameters did not differ significantly from those for ipsilateral OS-CCHs. 8. Oscillations tended to affect both the temporal structure and net rate of unit firing. For each unit, the firing rate was clamped to a narrow range of frequencies during oscillatory episodes. The coefficient of variation (SD/mean) of firing rates was significantly reduced during oscillatory episodes compared with prior rates (P {\textless} 0.001, paired t-test). However, the overall mean firing rate of each unit during all oscillatory episodes did not differ from its average rate immediately before the episodes. Thus oscillatory episodes tended to clamp mean firing rates to the cells' average rates outside episodes. 9. The strength of synchronization between units during oscillatory episodes was unrelated to their involvement in the task. For pairs of precentral units recorded ipsilaterally, the probability of occurrence of significant features in the OS-CCH was slightly larger when both units of the pair were task related (33 of 56 pairs or 59{\%}) than when only one unit was task related (20 of 39 pairs or 51{\%}) or neither unit was task related (7 of 16 or 44{\%}). However, these differences were not statistically significant. The magnitude of the correlation peak and the latency to peak were also not significantly different for the three cases. 10. These results suggest that units across wide regions can become transiently synchronized specifically during LFP oscillations, even if their spikes are uncorrelated during nonoscillatory periods.},

Clinical investigations are underway for a variety of other conditions. Yet, the therapeutic mechanisms of action are unknown. In addition, DBS research demonstrates the need to re-consider many hypotheses regarding basal ganglia physiology and pathophysiology such as the notion that increased activity in the globus pallidus internal segment is causal to Parkinson's disease symptoms. Studies reveal a variety of apparently discrepant results. At the least, it is unclear which DBS effects are therapeutically effective. This systematic review attempts to organize current DBS research into a series of unifying themes or issues such as whether the therapeutic effects are local or systems-wide or whether the effects are related to inhibition or excitation. A number of alternative hypotheses are offered for consideration including suppression of abnormal activity, striping basal ganglia output of misinformation, reduction of abnormal stochastic resonance effects due to increased noise in the disease state, and reinforcement of dynamic modulation of neuronal activity by resonance effects.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent initiatives in bioelectronic modulation of the nervous system by the NIH (SPARC), DARPA (ElectRx, SUBNETS) and the GlaxoSmithKline Bioelectronic Medicines effort are ushering in a new era of therapeutic electrical stimulation. These novel therapies are prompting a re-evaluation of established electrical thresholds for stimulation-induced tissue damage.

APPROACH: In this review, we explore what is known and unknown in published literature regarding tissue damage from electrical stimulation.

MAIN RESULTS: For macroelectrodes, the potential for tissue damage is often assessed by comparing the intensity of stimulation, characterized by the charge density and charge per phase of a stimulus pulse, with a damage threshold identified through histological evidence from in vivo experiments as described by the Shannon equation. While the Shannon equation has proved useful in assessing the likely occurrence of tissue damage, the analysis is limited by the experimental parameters of the original studies. Tissue damage is influenced by factors not explicitly incorporated into the Shannon equation, including pulse frequency, duty cycle, current density, and electrode size. Microelectrodes in particular do not follow the charge per phase and charge density co-dependence reflected in the Shannon equation. The relevance of these factors to tissue damage is framed in the context of available reports from modeling and in vivo studies.

SIGNIFICANCE: It is apparent that emerging applications, especially with microelectrodes, will require clinical charge densities that exceed traditional damage thresholds. Experimental data show that stimulation at higher charge densities can be achieved without causing tissue damage, suggesting that safety parameters for microelectrodes might be distinct from those defined for macroelectrodes. However, these increased charge densities may need to be justified by bench, non-clinical or clinical testing to provide evidence of device safety.},

abstract = {Replacing the function of a missing or paralyzed limb with a prosthetic device that acts and feels like one's own limb is a major goal in applied neuroscience. Recent studies in nonhuman primates have shown that motor control and sensory feedback can be achieved by connecting sensors in a robotic arm to electrodes implanted in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether electrical brain stimulation can be used to create a sense of ownership of an artificial limb. In this study on two human subjects, we show that ownership of an artificial hand can be induced via the electrical stimulation of the hand section of the somatosensory (SI) cortex in synchrony with touches applied to a rubber hand. Importantly, the illusion was not elicited when the electrical stimulation was delivered asynchronously or to a portion of the SI cortex representing a body part other than the hand, suggesting that multisensory integration according to basic spatial and temporal congruence rules is the underlying mechanism of the illusion. These findings show that the brain is capable of integrating "natural" visual input and direct cortical-somatosensory stimulation to create the multisensory perception that an artificial limb belongs to one's own body. Thus, they serve as a proof of concept that electrical brain stimulation can be used to "bypass" the peripheral nervous system to induce multisensory illusions and ownership of artificial body parts, which has important implications for patients who lack peripheral sensory input due to spinal cord or nerve lesions.},

In the present study, we asked which cortical regions can exert the greatest influence over other regions and the cortical network as a whole. Previous research on this question has relied on coarse anatomy (mapping large fiber pathways) or functional connectivity (mapping inter-regional statistical dependencies in ongoing activity). Here we combined direct electrical stimulation with recordings from the cortical surface to provide a novel insight into directed, inter-regional influence within the cerebral cortex of awake humans. These networks of directed interaction were reproducible across strength thresholds and across subjects. Directed network properties included (1) a decrease in the reciprocity of connections with distance; (2) major projector nodes (sources of influence) were found in peri-Rolandic cortex and posterior, basal and polar regions of the temporal lobe; and (3) major receiver nodes (receivers of influence) were found in anterolateral frontal, superior parietal, and superior temporal regions. Connectivity maps derived from electrical stimulation and from resting electrocorticography (ECoG) correlations showed similar spatial distributions for the same source node. However, higher-level network topology analysis revealed differences between electrical stimulation and ECoG that were partially related to the reciprocity of connections. Together, these findings inform our understanding of large-scale corticocortical influence as well as the interpretation of functional connectivity networks.},

We show that microstimulation within the hand area of the somatosensory cortex of a person with long-term spinal cord injury evokes tactile sensations perceived as originating from locations on the hand and that cortical stimula-tion sites are organized according to expected somatotopic principles. Many of these percepts exhibit naturalistic characteristics (including feelings of pressure), can be evoked at low stimulation amplitudes, and remain stable for months. Further, modulating the stimulus amplitude grades the perceptual intensity of the stimuli, suggesting that intracortical microstimulation could be used to convey information about the contact location and pressure neces-sary to perform dexterous hand movements associated with object manipulation.},

abstract = {Objective. To determine whether patients with neocortical epilepsy show evidence for increased excitability measured by cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) in ictal-onset regions. Methods. In patients undergoing intracranial recordings with subdural electrodes for epilepsy surgery, we measured amplitudes, latencies, and stimulus thresholds of CCEPs near ictal onset zones (iCCEPs), and compared with adjacent neocortex not associated with ictal EEG (nCCEP). CCEP amplitude and latency measurements were made with each stimulation site, using graded stimulation intensities. Results. Ten patients were included in this study. CCEPs were recorded in eight of 10 patients. The first negative (N1) iCCEP amplitude was higher than that of nCCEP in seven of the eight patients. In the group analysis, this difference was statistically significant. In three of these patients, the difference was individually significant. In one patient, the amplitude was higher in nCCEP than iCCEP and the area selected as nCCEP was within primary eloquent cortex. There was no significant difference seen in latency changes or stimulus threshold. Conclusions. Accentuated CCEP amplitudes near ictal onset zones could reflect an increased excitability of the cortex associated with the epileptogenic zone in some patients with neocortical epilepsy. The response of the neocortex to low-frequency stimulation may vary depending on the presence or absence of intrinsic epileptogenicity.},

abstract = {In a series of 40 patients undergoing an awake craniotomy for the removal of a glioma of the dominant hemisphere temporal lobe, cortical stimulation mapping was used to localize essential language sites. These sites were localized to distinct temporal lobe sectors and compared with 83 patients without tumors who had undergone language mapping for the treatment of intractable epilepsy. In patients with and without temporal lobe gliomas, the superior temporal gyrus contained significantly more language sites than the middle temporal gyrus. Both patient populations also had language sites anterior to the central sulcus in the superior temporal gyrus (12-16{\%}). The patients without tumors had significantly more language sites in the superior temporal gyrus, compared with the superior temporal gyrus of patients with temporal lobe tumors. Multiple variables were studied for their effect on preoperative and postoperative language deficits and included age, sex, number of language sites, histology, size of the tumor, and the distance of tumor resection margins from the nearest language site. The distance of the resection margin from the nearest language site was the most important variable in determining the improvement in preoperative language deficits, the duration of postoperative language deficits, and whether the postoperative language deficits were permanent. If the distance of the resection margin from the nearest language site was {\textgreater} 1 cm, significantly fewer permanent language deficits occurred. Cortical stimulation mapping for the identification of essential language sites in patients with gliomas of the dominant hemisphere temporal lobe will maximize the extent of tumor resection and minimize permanent language deficits.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: To estimate the number of adults in the United States from 2006 to 2012 who manifest selected health and social outcomes 5 years following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that required acute inpatient rehabilitation. DESIGN:: Secondary data analysis. SETTING:: Acute inpatient rehabilitation facilities. PARTICIPANTS:: Patients 16 years and older receiving acute inpatient rehabilitation for a primary diagnosis of TBI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:: Mortality, functional independence, societal participation, subjective well-being, and global outcome. RESULTS:: Annually from 2001 to 2007, an average of 13 700 patients aged 16 years or older received acute inpatient rehabilitation in the United States with a primary diagnosis of TBI. Approximately 1 in 5 patients had died by the 5-year postinjury assessment. Among survivors, 12{\%} were institutionalized and 50{\%} had been rehospitalized at least once. Approximately one-third of patients were not independent in everyday activities. Twenty-nine percent were dissatisfied with life, with 8{\%} reporting markedly depressed mood. Fifty-seven percent were moderately or severely disabled overall, with 39{\%} having deteriorated from a global outcome attained 1 or 2 years postinjury. Of those employed preinjury, 55{\%} were unemployed. Poorer medical, functional, and participation outcomes were associated with, but not limited to, older age. Younger age groups had poorer mental and emotional outcomes. Deterioration in global outcome was common and not age-related. CONCLUSIONS:: Significant mortality and morbidity were evident at 5 years postinjury. The deterioration in global outcomes observed regardless of age suggests that multiple influences contribute to poorer outcomes. Public health interventions intended to reduce post-acute inpatient rehabilitation mortality and morbidity rates will need to be multifaceted and age-specific.},

abstract = {One approach for modelling substrate noise coupling in mixed-signal integrated circuits is to calculate the surface potential at each point of interest caused by currents injected into the semiconductor substrate by different aggressor elements. However, calculation of the surface potential analytically is a very complicated problem and exact solutions are only available for a few simple configurations such as a single circular disc and two coplanar circular discs on a uniform semi-infinite substrate. For more complex situations approximate models using superposition of one-contact potentials is a more attractive approach. Therefore, this work compares the approximate superposition-model for the resistance between two coplanar circular discs on a uniform semi-infinite substrate with the exact solution, in order to give an estimate of the error introduced by using the superposition-model. It is seen that the error is very small when the separation distance between the discs are larger than roughly one contact radius, thus giving theoretical support for the already experimentally tested superposition-model. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Herring2015,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: Cortical oscillations, such as 8-12 Hz alpha-band activity, are thought to subserve gating of information processing in the human brain. While most of the supporting evidence is correlational, causal evidence comes from attempts to externally drive ("entrain") these oscillations by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Indeed, the frequency profile of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) closely resembles that of oscillations spontaneously emerging in the same brain region. However, it is unclear whether TMS-locked and spontaneous oscillations are produced by the same neuronal mechanisms. If so, they should react in a similar manner to top-down modulation by endogenous attention. To test this prediction, we assessed the alpha-like EEG response to TMS of the visual cortex during periods of high and low visual attention while participants attended to either the visual or auditory modality in a cross-modal attention task. We observed a TMS-locked local oscillatory alpha response lasting several cycles after TMS (but not after sham stimulation). Importantly, TMS-locked alpha power was suppressed during deployment of visual relative to auditory attention, mirroring spontaneous alpha amplitudes. In addition, the early N40 TEP component, located at the stimulation site, was amplified by visual attention. The extent of attentional modulation for both TMS-locked alpha power and N40 amplitude did depend, with opposite sign, on the individual ability to modulate spontaneous alpha power at the stimulation site. We therefore argue that TMS-locked and spontaneous oscillations are of common neurophysiological origin, whereas the N40 TEP component may serve as an index of current cortical excitability at the time of stimulation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising tool to experimentally "entrain" cortical activity. If TMS-locked oscillatory responses actually recruit the same neuronal mechanisms as spontaneous cortical oscillations, they qualify as a valid tool to study the causal role of neuronal oscillations in cognition but also to enable new treatments targeting aberrant oscillatory activity in, for example, neurological conditions. Here, we provide first-time evidence that TMS-locked and spontaneous oscillations are indeed tightly related and are likely to rely on the same neuronal generators. In addition, we demonstrate that an early local component of the TMS-evoked potential (the N40) may serve as a new objective and noninvasive probe of visual cortex excitability, which so far was only accessible via subjective phosphene reports.},

abstract = {Previous studies focusing on the temporal rules governing changes in synaptic strength during spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) have paid little attention to the fact that synaptic inputs are distributed across complex dendritic trees. During STDP, propagation of action potentials (APs) back to the site of synaptic input is thought to trigger plasticity. However, in pyramidal neurons, backpropagation of single APs is decremental, whereas high-frequency bursts lead to generation of distal dendritic calcium spikes. This raises the question whether STDP learning rules depend on synapse location and firing mode. Here, we investigate this issue at synapses between layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex. We find that low-frequency pairing of single APs at positive times leads to a distance-dependent shift to long-term depression (LTD) at distal inputs. At proximal sites, this LTD could be converted to long-term potentiation (LTP) by dendritic depolarizations suprathreshold for BAC-firing or by high-frequency AP bursts. During AP bursts, we observed a progressive, distance-dependent shift in the timing requirements for induction of LTP and LTD, such that distal synapses display novel timing rules: they potentiate when inputs are activated after burst onset (negative timing) but depress when activated before burst onset (positive timing). These findings could be explained by distance-dependent differences in the underlying dendritic voltage waveforms driving NMDA receptor activation during STDP induction. Our results suggest that synapse location within the dendritic tree is a crucial determinant of STDP, and that synapses undergo plasticity according to local rather than global learning rules.},

abstract = {The role of cortical connectivity in brain function and pathology is increasingly being recognized. While in vivo magnetic resonance imaging studies have provided important insights into anatomical and functional connectivity, these methodologies are limited in their ability to detect electrophysiological activity and the causal relationships that underlie effective connectivity. Here, we describe results of cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) mapping using single pulse electrical stimulation in 25 patients undergoing seizure monitoring with subdural electrode arrays. Mapping was performed by stimulating adjacent electrode pairs and recording CCEPs from the remainder of the electrode array. CCEPs reliably revealed functional networks and showed an inverse relationship to distance between sites. Coregistration to Brodmann areas (BA) permitted group analysis. Connections were frequently directional with 43{\%} of early responses and 50{\%} of late responses of connections reflecting relative dominance of incoming or outgoing connections. The most consistent connections were seen as outgoing from motor cortex, BA6-BA9, somatosensory (SS) cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and Broca's area. Network topology revealed motor, SS, and premotor cortices along with BA9 and BA10 and language areas to serve as hubs for cortical connections. BA20 and BA39 demonstrated the most consistent dominance of outdegree connections, while BA5, BA7, auditory cortex, and anterior cingulum demonstrated relatively greater indegree. This multicenter, large-scale, directional study of local and long-range cortical connectivity using direct recordings from awake, humans will aid the interpretation of noninvasive functional connectome studies.

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class iden- tification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large da- tabases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solu- tion to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to dis- cover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an ap- propriate value for it. We performed an experimental evalua- tion of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 bench- mark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clus- ters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR- ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract = {Background: Effective connectivity can be explored using direct electrical stimulations in patients suffering from drug-resistant focal epilepsies and investigated with intracranial electrodes. Responses to brief electrical pulses mimic the physiological propagation of signals and manifest as cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEP). The first CCEP component is believed to reflect direct connectivity with the stimulated region but the stimulation artifact, a sharp deflection occurring during a few milliseconds, frequently contaminates it. New method: In order to recover the characteristics of early CCEP responses, we developed an artifact correction method based on electrical modeling of the electrode-tissue interface. The biophysically motivated artifact templates are then regressed out of the recorded data as in any classical template-matching removal artifact methods. Results: Our approach is able to make the distinction between the physiological responses time-locked to the stimulation pulses and the non-physiological component. We tested the correction on simulated CCEP data in order to quantify its efficiency for different stimulation and recording parameters. We demonstrated the efficiency of the new correction method on simulations of single trial recordings for early responses contaminated with the stimulation artifact. The results highlight the importance of sampling frequency for an accurate analysis of CCEP. We then applied the approach to experimental data. Comparison with existing method: The model-based template removal was compared to a correction based on the subtraction of the averaged artifact. Conclusions: This new correction method of stimulation artifact will enable investigators to better analyze early CCEP components and infer direct effective connectivity in future CCEP studies.},

abstract = {Introduction The clinical results for the RNS System (NeuroPace, Mountain View, California, USA) closed-loop responsive neurostimulator for the treatment of medically intractable partial-onset seizures have been encouraging. The University of Southern California (USC) Neurorestoration Center and the Keck Hospital of USC have become the world's first institutions to implant an RNS System post U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. As one of the study centers, we review our experience with our group of patients who have been implanted with the RNS System. Methods A total of 40 surgeries by a single surgeon were performed on 10 patients (7 male and 3 female) with an average age of 39.2 years (24-66 years) and were followed for an average of 45 months (30-54 months). The average age at seizure onset was 14 years (birth-37 years) with an average of 4.7 (3-12) failed antiepileptic drugs. We reviewed the patients' charts for complications from the surgeries including infections requiring surgical intervention, hematomas, hardware failures, and death. Results Of the 40 surgeries, there were 10 initial implantations of the neurostimulator and leads, 24 neurostimulator replacements for expected end of neurostimulator service, 2 incision and drainage procedures (I {\&} Ds) for soft tissue infection followed by 1 explantation and 1 reimplantation (same patient), and 2 revisions because of one lead that was damaged at the exit point between the skull and a titanium mesh and the second lead that was damaged at an acute bend over the skull (same patient). Eight of the patients had no complications and underwent an average of 2.7 neurostimulator replacements over 7 consecutive years to date. Each patient underwent routine postoperative computed tomography imaging of the brain, and none had any intracranial hematomas or misplaced leads requiring revision surgery. Finally, there were no deaths in our patient population. Conclusions Our experience with the NeuroPace RNS System over an average follow-up of 45 months suggests that the surgery and device are safe when placed by an experienced surgeon. Although there were no clinically significant hematomas or patient deaths, we did have 1 patient each with infection and lead damage at the point of exit from the skull. We compare the results of this study with other neuromodulation procedures for epilepsy to evaluate the safety and complications associated with the RNS System. Our initial experience suggests that the RNS System can be readily incorporated into an active epilepsy surgical center.},

abstract = {Objective: To better understand pathological neuronal excitation in epilepsy by comparing cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) responses in regions with different ictal onset patterns: focal paroxysmal fast (PF) and repetitive spiking (RS). Methods: Fourteen patients undergoing invasive monitoring (six patients with PF and eight with RS) were studied with CCEPs. A repetitive 1Hz bipolar electrical stimulus was applied to both the ictal onset region (iCCEP) and to a control region (nCCEP) and CCEPs were recorded from the surrounding electrodes. The two groups were compared by subtracting the amplitude of nCCEP from that of iCCEP (CCEP ictal-control) at each stimulus intensity, and then normalizing the amplitudes of iCCEP at maximum stimulus intensity by dividing by nCCEP (CCEP ictal/control). Results: The CCEP response to stimulation in the ictal onset region was significantly larger than to control stimulation for both ictal patterns (paroxysmal fast: P=0.02, repetitive spiking: P{\textless}0.01), with repetitive spiking group amplitudes higher than the paroxysmal fast group (CCEP ictal-control: P{\textless}0.01 and CCEP ictal/control: P=0.04). Conclusions: Pro-epileptic excitability is more accentuated in regions showing an ictal repetitive spiking pattern than a paroxysmal fast pattern. Significance: These findings confirm in a new way that cortical excitability varies depending on the ictal onset pattern. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

On the one hand, the model may be expanded as a Taylor series and corrections to the several parameters calculated at each iteration on the assumption of local lincarity. On the other hand, various modifications of the method of steepest-descent have been used. Both methods not infrequently run aground, the Taylor series method because of divergence of the successive iterates, the steepest-descent (or gradient) methods because of agonizingly slow convergence after the first few iterations. In this paper a maximum neighborhood method is developed which, in effect, performs an optimum interpolation between the Taylor series method and the gradient method, the interpolation being based upon the maximum neighborhood in which the truncated Taylor series gives an adequate representation of the nonlinear model. The results are extended to the problem of solving a set of nonlinear algebraic equations.},

A growing body of evidence has shown that delta (1-4 Hz) oscillatory activity, the characteristic electroencephalographic signature of SWS, is involved in coordinating interaction between the hippocampus and the neocortex and is thought to take a role in stabilizing memory traces related to a novel task. This case report describes a new protocol that uses neuroprosthetics training of a non-human primate to evaluate the effects of surface cortical electrical stimulation triggered from SWS cycles. The results suggest that stimulation phase-locked to SWS oscillatory activity promoted learning of the neuroprosthetic task. This protocol could be used to elucidate mechanisms of synaptic plasticity underlying off-line learning during sleep and offers new insights into the role of brain oscillations in information processing and memory consolidation.},

Patients executed robot-assisted wrist extension movements at 0.2 Hz frequency while subthreshold repetitive TMS was applied over M1 in a strict temporal relationship to the training movements. TMS was applied to either the affected hemisphere (contralateral M1) or the nonaffected hemisphere (ipsilateral M1) at 0.1 Hz. Intervention-related changes in motor maps and intracortical excitability were measured using TMS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Training alone or combined Hebbian-type stimulation of either M1 resulted in differential effects on motor maps and intracortical inhibition. Shifts in motor maps were associated with increases in intracortical excitability. In contrast to previous results for healthy participants, the inhibitory effect of ipsilateral M1 Hebbian-type stimulation was not present, and the facilitatory effect of contralateral M1 stimulation was more subtle.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Hebbian-type stimulation is feasible in patients poststroke and induces map reorganization and associated decreases in GABAergic inhibition. However, because TMS protocols have a different effect on motor reorganization in the injured brain and may depend on location of the lesion, protocols need to be tailored to the patient's pathology.},

abstract = {Electrical microstimulation has been used to elucidate cortical function. This review discusses neuronal excitability and effective current spread estimated by using three different methods: 1) single-cell recording, 2) behavioral methods, and 3) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The excitability properties of the stimulated elements in neocortex obtained using these methods were found to be comparable. These properties suggested that microstimulation activates the most excitable elements in cortex, that is, by and large the fibers of the pyramidal cells. Effective current spread within neocortex was found to be greater when measured with fMRI compared with measures based on single-cell recording or behavioral methods. The spread of activity based on behavioral methods is in close agreement with the spread based on the direct activation of neurons (as opposed to those activated synaptically). We argue that the greater activation with imaging is attributed to transynaptic spread, which includes subthreshold activation of sites connected to the site of stimulation. The definition of effective current spread therefore depends on the neural event being measured.},

@article{Guler2018,
abstract = {Direct stimulation of the cortical surface is used clinically for cortical mapping and modulation of local activity. Future applications of cortical modulation and brain-computer interfaces may also use cortical stimulation methods. One common method to deliver current is through electrocorticography (ECoG) stimulation in which a dense array of electrodes are placed subdurally or epidurally to stimulate the cortex. However, proximity to cortical tissue limits the amount of current that can be delivered safely. It may be desirable to deliver higher current to a specific local region of interest (ROI) while limiting current to other local areas more stringently than is guaranteed by global safety limits. Two commonly used global safety constraints bound the total injected current and individual electrode currents. However, these two sets of constraints may not be sufficient to prevent high current density locally (hot-spots). In this work, we propose an efficient approach that prevents current density hot-spots in the entire brain while optimizing ECoG stimulus patterns for targeted stimulation. Specifically, we maximize the current along a particular desired directional field in the ROI while respecting three safety constraints: one on the total injected current, one on individual electrode currents, and the third on the local current density magnitude in the brain. This third set of constraints creates a computational barrier due to the huge number of constraints needed to bound the current density at every point in the entire brain. We overcome this barrier by adopting an efficient two-step approach. In the first step, the proposed method identifies the safe brain region, which cannot contain any hot-spots solely based on the global bounds on total injected current and individual electrode currents. In the second step, the proposed algorithm iteratively adjusts the stimulus pattern to arrive at a solution that exhibits no hot-spots in the remaining brain. We report on simulations on a realistic finite element (FE) head model with five anatomical ROIs and two desired directional fields. We also report on the effect of ROI depth and desired directional field on the focality of the stimulation. Finally, we provide an analysis of optimization runtime as a function of different safety and modeling parameters. Our results suggest that optimized stimulus patterns tend to differ from those used in clinical practice.},

abstract = {In order to examine the effects of repetitive stimulation on functional cortical organization, standard intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) techniques were used to generate maps of movement representations in motor cortex of rat. After identification of caudal and rostral forelimb fields and adjacent vibrissae and neck fields, one or more representational borders were defined in greater detail. Then a microelectrode was introduced into one of these representational fields, and ICMS current pulses were delivered at a rate of 1/sec for 1 to 3 hr. Following repetitive ICMS, significant changes in movement representations were observed using current levels that were either suprathreshold or subthreshold for evoking the site-specific movement. Electromyographic activity could be evoked at suprathreshold and near-threshold current levels, but not at the subthreshold current levels used here. Significant border shifts ranged from 210 to 670 microns. In each case in which shifts occurred, there appeared to be expansion of the movement represented at the repetitively stimulated site. The effects were progressive and reversible. These results suggest that at least under these unusual experimental circumstances, large representational changes can be generated very rapidly within motor cortex in the absence of any evident peripheral feedback.},

Recently, it has found increasing use in electrotherapy and neural prostheses. However, the manner in which electrical stimulation-elicited signals propagate in brain tissues remains unclear. We used combined electrostimulation, neurophysiology, microinjection and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the cortical activity patterns elicited during stimulation of cortical afferents in monkeys. We found that stimulation of a site in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) increased the fMRI signal in the regions of primary visual cortex (V1) that received input from that site, but suppressed it in the retinotopically matched regions of extrastriate cortex. Consistent with previous observations, intracranial recordings indicated that a short excitatory response occurring immediately after a stimulation pulse was followed by a long-lasting inhibition. Following microinjections of GABA antagonists in V1, LGN stimulation induced positive fMRI signals in all of the cortical areas. Taken together, our findings suggest that electrical stimulation disrupts cortico-cortical signal propagation by silencing the output of any neocortical area whose afferents are electrically stimulated.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents a powerful clinical technology, but a systematic characterization of the electrical interactions between the electrode and the brain is lacking. The goal of this study was to examine the in vivo changes in the DBS electrode impedance that occur after implantation and during clinically relevant stimulation. Clinical DBS devices typically apply high-frequency voltage-controlled stimulation, and as a result, the injected current is directly regulated by the impedance of the electrode-tissue interface. We monitored the impedance of scaled-down clinical DBS electrodes implanted in the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus of a rhesus macaque using electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements ranging from 0.5 Hz to 10 kHz. To further characterize our measurements, equivalent circuit models of the electrode-tissue interface were used to quantify the role of various interface components in producing the observed electrode impedance. Following implantation, the DBS electrode impedance increased and a semicircular arc was observed in the high-frequency range of the EIS measurements, commonly referred to as the tissue component of the impedance. Clinically relevant stimulation produced a rapid decrease in electrode impedance with extensive changes in the tissue component. These post-operative and stimulation-induced changes in impedance could play an important role in the observed functional effects of voltage-controlled DBS and should be considered during clinical stimulation parameter selection and chronic animal research studies.},

abstract = {Modern neurophysiological experiments frequently involve multiple channels separated by very small distances. A unique methodological concern for multiple-electrode experiments is that of capacitive coupling (cross-talk) between channels. Yet the nature of the cross-talk recording circuit is not well known in the field, and the extent to which it practically affects neurophysiology experiments has never been fully investigated. Here we describe a simple electrical circuit model of simultaneous recording and stimulation with two or more channels and experimentally verify the model using ex vivo brain slice and in vivo whole-brain preparations. In agreement with the model, we find that cross-talk amplitudes increase nearly linearly with the impedance of a recording electrode and are larger for higher frequencies. We demonstrate cross-talk contamination of action potential waveforms from intracellular to extracellular channels, which is observable in part because of the different orders of magnitude between the channels. This contamination is electrode impedance-dependent and matches predictions from the model. We use recently published parameters to simulate cross-talk in high-density multichannel extracellular recordings. Cross-talk effectively spatially smooths current source density (CSD) estimates in these recordings and induces artefactual phase shifts where underlying voltage gradients occur; however, these effects are modest. We show that the effects of cross-talk are unlikely to affect most conclusions inferred from neurophysiology experiments when both originating and receiving electrode record signals of similar magnitudes. We discuss other types of experiments and analyses that may be susceptible to cross-talk, techniques for detecting and experimentally reducing cross-talk, and implications for high-density probe design.NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY We develop and experimentally verify an electrical circuit model describing cross-talk that necessarily occurs between two channels. Recorded cross-talk increased with electrode impedance and signal frequency. We recorded cross-talk contamination of spike waveforms from intracellular to extracellular channels. We simulated high-density multichannel extracellular recordings and demonstrate spatial smoothing and phase shifts that cross-talk enacts on CSD measurements. However, when channels record similar-magnitude signals, effects are modest and unlikely to affect most conclusions.},

@article{Heller1992,
abstract = {We prove that, at the frequencies generally proposed for extracranial stimulation of the brain, it is not possible, using any superposition of external current sources, to produce a three-dimensional local maximum of the electric field strength inside the brain. The maximum always occurs on a boundary where the conductivity jumps in value. Nevertheless, it may be possible to achieve greater two-dimensional focusing and shaping of the electric field than is currently available. Towards this goal we have used the reciprocity theorem to present a uniform treatment of the electric field inside a conducting medium produced by a variety of sources: an external magnetic dipole (current loop), an external electric dipole (linear antenna), and surface and depth electrodes. This formulation makes use of the lead fields from magneto- and electroencephalography. For the special case of a system with spherically symmetric conductivity, we derive a simple analytic formula for the electric field due to an external magnetic dipole. This formula is independent of the conductivity profile and therefore embraces spherical models with any number of shells. This explains the "insensitivity" to the skull's conductivity that has been described in numerical studies. We also present analytic formulas for the electric field due to an electric dipole, and also surface and depth electrodes, for the case of a sphere of constant conductivity. {\textcopyright} 1992, The Biophysical Society.

These approaches are evaluated from the perspective of electrophysiological studies, which involve multivariate (i.e., spatiotemporal) observations in which source-level signals are picked up to a certain extent by all sensors. Besides formal statistical techniques, there are also techniques that do not involve probability calculations but are very useful in dealing with multivariate data (i.e., verification of data-based predictions, cross-validation, and localizers). Moreover, data-based decision making can also be informed by mechanistic evidence that is provided by the structure in the data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the feasibility of a fully implanted cortical stimulator for improving hand and arm function in patients following ischemic stroke.METHOD:Twenty-four chronic stroke patients with hemiplegia were randomized to targeted implanted cortical electrical stimulation of the motor cortex with upper limb rehabilitation therapy or rehabilitation therapy alone.RESULTS:Using repeated measures regression models, we estimated and compared treatment effects between groups over the study follow-up period. The investigational group had significantly greater mean improvements in Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) scores during the 6-month follow-up period (weeks 1-24 following therapy), as compared to the control group (difference in estimated means = 3.8, p = .042). Box and Block (B {\&} B) test improvement from baseline scores were also significantly better in the investigational group across the 6-month follow-up assessments (difference in estimated means = 3.8, p = .046). There was one report of seizure after device implant but prior to cortical stimulation and rehabilitation therapy, but no reports of neurologic decline. There were no improvements seen in the other measures assessed.CONCLUSION:Evidence suggests that cortical stimulation with rehabilitation therapy produces a lasting treatment effect in upper extremity motor control and is not associated with serious neurological complications. A larger multicenter study is underway.},

Despite widespread recognition of the importance of spatiotemporally precise causal control over cellular signaling, for nearly the first half (2005–2009) of this 10-year period, as optogenetics was being created, there were difficulties in implementation, few publications and limited biological findings. In contrast, the ensuing years have witnessed a substantial acceleration in the application domain, with the publication of thousands of discoveries and insights into the function of nervous systems and beyond.

@article{Lu2012,
abstract = {In visual prosthesis research, electrically evoked potentials (EEPs) can be elicited by one or more biphasic current pulses delivered to the optic nerve (ON) through penetrating electrodes. Multi-channel EEPs recorded from the visual cortex usually contain large stimulus artifacts caused by instantaneous electrotonic current spread through the brain tissue. These stimulus artifacts contaminate the EEP waveform and often make subsequent analysis of the underlying neural responses difficult. This is particularly serious when investigating EEPs in response to electrical stimulation with long duration and multi-pulses. We applied independent component analysis (ICA) to remove these electrical stimulation-induced artifacts during the development of a visual prosthesis. Multi-channel signals were recorded from visual cortices of five rabbits in response to ON electrical stimulation with various stimulus parameters. ON action potentials were then blocked by lidocaine in order to acquire cortical potentials only including stimulus artifacts. Correlation analysis of reconstructed artifacts by ICA and artifacts recorded after blocking the ON indicates successful removal of artifacts from electrical stimulation by the ICA method. This technique has potential applications in studies designed to optimize the electrical stimulation parameters used by visual prostheses.},

@article{Miceli2017,
abstract = {Brain research investigating electrical activity within neural tissue is producing an increasing amount of physiological data including local field potentials (LFPs) obtained via extracellular in vivo and in vitro recordings. In order to correctly interpret such electrophysiological data, it is vital to adequately understand the electrical properties of neural tissue itself. An ongoing controversy in the field of neuroscience is whether such frequency-dependent effects bias LFP recordings and affect the proper interpretation of the signal. On macroscopic scales and with large injected currents, previous studies have found various grades of frequency dependence of cortical tissue, ranging from negligible to strong, within the frequency band typically considered relevant for neuroscience (less than a few thousand hertz). Here, we performed a detailed investigation of the frequency dependence of the conductivity within cortical tissue at microscopic distances using small current amplitudes within the typical (neuro)physiological micrometer and sub-nanoampere range. We investigated the propagation of LFPs, induced by extracellular electrical current injections via patch-pipettes, in acute rat brain slice preparations containing the somatosensory cortex in vitro using multielectrode arrays. Based on our data, we determined the cortical tissue conductivity over a 100-fold increase in signal frequency (5–500 Hz). Our results imply at most very weak frequency-dependent effects within the frequency range of physiological LFPs. Using biophysical modeling, we estimated the impact of different putative impedance spectra. Our results indicate that frequency dependencies of the order measured here and in most other studies have negligible impact on the typical analysis and modeling of LFP signals from extracellular brain recordings.},

abstract = {Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has treatment efficacy in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease and major depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a versatile neurophysiological tool that can be used to better understand DBS treatment mechanisms. DBS causes artifacts in EEG recordings that preclude meaningful neurophysiological activity from being quantified during stimulation. New method: In this study, we modeled the DBS stimulation artifact and illustrated a technique for removing the artifact using matched filters. The approach was validated using a synthetically generated DBS artifact superimposed on EEG data. Mean squared error (MSE) between the recovered signal and the artifact-free signal was used to quantify the effectiveness of the approach. Results: The DBS artifact was characterized by a series of narrow band components at the harmonic frequencies of DBS stimulation. The filtering approach successfully removed the DBS artifact with MSE value being less than 2{\%} of base signal power for the typical stimulation and recording setups. General guidelines on how to setup DBS EEG studies and configure the subsequent artifact removal process are described. Comparison with previous method: To avoid stimulus artifacts, a number of EEG studies with DBS subjects have resorted to turning the stimulator off during recording, while other studies have used low pass filters to remove artifacts and look at frequencies well below 50. Hz. Conclusions: This study establishes a method through which DBS artifact in EEG recordings can be reliably eliminated, thereby preserving a meaningful neurophysiological signal through which to better understand DBS treatment mechanisms.},
