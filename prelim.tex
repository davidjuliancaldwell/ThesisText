\abstract{%
Damage to the nervous system due to stroke, spinal cord injury, and limb loss leads to significant sensory and motor deficits. Despite the variety of reasons behind cortical injury, targeted direct electrical stimulation (DES) may be able to help restore both motor and sensory function in future neuroprosthetic applications. Despite progress in non-human models of DCS, the application of DES in humans is not well characterized or understood. A number of fundamental barriers need to be addressed through a principled engineering approach before true translation of DES in humans can be achieved. First, the modeling of how electrical stimulation propagates through the tissue, and subsequently how to extract neural dynamics in the context of direct cortical stimulation is not well understood. Second, the understanding of the human response to DES, and the ongoing neural dynamics during behavior, have not been directly compared to natural feedback. Third, various stimulation protocols for sensorimotor cortex to induce plasticity have not been validated with DES in humans. My dissertation seeks to address these three issues through the lens of engineered stimulation of sensorimotor cortex in humans with implanted electrodes, to move DES closer towards clinical rehabilitation use.

\begin{glossary}
\item[ECoG] Electrocorticography. This refers to electrodes implanted subdurally, epidurally, or in deeper gray or whiter matter structures (depth electrodes), but in this thesis, all references refer to either subdural or depth electrodes. 
\item[DBS] Deep Brain Stimulation. 
\item[EEG] Electroencephalography. This refers to the placement of electrodes on the scalp. 
\item[LFP] Local field potential. These are the composite signal from multiple neurons firing.
\item[DES] Direct electrical stimulation. In this thesis, this refers to stimulation of any region of the brain, cortically or subcortically, through implanted electrodes.
\item[DCS] Direct cortical stimulation. This refers to the electrical stimulation of the cortex through implanted electrodes. 
\item[DECS] Direct electrical cortical stimulation. In this thesis, this is synonymous with DCS.
\item[CSF] Cerebrospinal fluid - clear fluid which provides cushioning, waste removal, and distribution of materials throughout the brain
\item[Dura] The outermost layer covering the brain and spinal cord. Subdural electrodes are implanted beneath the dura, and above the arachnoid and pia
\item[Craniotomy] Surgical procedure in which bone is removed from the skull temporarily to gain access to the brain
\item[Epilepsy] A disorder described by recurrent unprovoked seizures
\item[DBS] Deep brain stimulation: a treatment using electrical stimulation to treat movement disorders (Parkinson's, Essential Tremor), and increasingly psychiatric disorders
\item[FEM] Finite element modeling. The use of a discretized mesh representing a surface, and the forward modeling of partial differential equations of interest (e.g. Laplaceâ€™s equation for electrostatics)
\item[Contact resistance] Total resistance of the electrode, electrode tissue interface, CSF, and brain 
\item[Sheet resistance] Intrinsic resistance of the material of interest 
\item[EP] Evoked potential. The cortical response due to DCS, which is the recorded complex activity resulting from the superposition of numerous neuronal elements. 
\item[EMG] Electromyography. The electrical recording of muscle activity
\item[SSEP] Somatosensory evoked potential. The signal in cortex following peripheral median nerve stimulation. 
\item[MEP] Motor evoked potential. A robust EMG in a peripheral muscle that occurs following DCS of motor cortex regions. 
\item[DBSCAN] A density based clustering algorithm 
\item[Unsupervised clustering] A machine learning method which discovers structure in the data without predefined user guidance. 
\item[Cathodal stimulation] Electrical stimulation which causes electrons and negative ions to gather at the electrode, causing depolarization directly beneath the electrode
\item[Anodal stimulation] Electrical stimulation which causes positive species to gather at the electrode, causing hyperpolarization directly beneath the electrode. 
\item[NMDA receptor] Receptor which binds NMDA, also functions as an ion channel, and is important for cellular plasticity. 
\item[fMRI] Functional magnetic resonance imaging. An non-invasive imaging method which allows for the indirect measurement of neuronal activity at a high spatial but low temporal resolution
\item[BOLD] Blood oxygen level dependent: The signal measured by fMRI, where decreases in blood oxygen locally correlate with neuronal activity.
